SONG 11: "Quotes from the Liars"
(Theme: Their Own Words Expose Them)


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Trump said it plain if you got ears to hear,
"I fly all the time, I own a jet, it's clear,
757, beautiful plane, the best,
If the world were round, I'd know—unlike the rest."

[Verse 2]
Buzz Aldrin slipped up, couldn't hold the lie,
"We didn't go there," almost started to cry,
"That's the way it happened, nice to know why,"
The moon landing's fake, they never touched the sky.

[Chorus]
"We'll know our disinfo program is complete,
When everything the public believes is deceit,"
William Casey, CIA, said it to the chief,
And here we are—a nation of false belief!

[Verse 3]
Hillary Clinton cracked the ceiling she said,
Eighteen million cracks—that's lies widespread,
The glass ceiling's fake just like everything else,
Puppets on strings dancing for the devil himself.

[Verse 4]
Red Hot Chili Peppers dropped the truth in a song,
"Space is made in a Hollywood basement"—sing along,
Californication told you everything,
But you bobbed your head, didn't hear a thing.

[Chorus]
"We'll know our disinfo program is complete,
When everything the public believes is deceit,"
William Casey, CIA, said it to the chief,
And here we are—a nation of false belief!

[Verse 5]
"If I were the devil," Paul Harvey began,
"I'd engulf the whole world, that's my plan,
Subvert the churches, whisper in ears,
'The Bible's a myth,' feed 'em lies for years."

[Verse 6]
"I'd have families at war, churches divided,
Nations destroying themselves—I'd have guided,
Judges promoting filth, God evicted,
From courtrooms and schools—exactly as predicted."

[Chorus]
"We'll know our disinfo program is complete,
When everything the public believes is deceit,"
William Casey, CIA, said it to the chief,
And here we are—a nation of false belief!

[Bridge]
"I'd substitute psychology for religion true,
Deify science—that's what I'd do,
Lure priests to corruption, money and boys,
Turn Easter to eggs and Christmas to toys."

[Verse 7]
"I'd undress you in public, lure you to bed,
With diseases no cure—and you'd wind up dead,
In other words if I were the devil I'd just keep on doing—"
What he's doing right now, humanity's ruining!

[Outro]
Their own words condemn them, the truth is in plain sight,
Open your eyes and step into the light.
