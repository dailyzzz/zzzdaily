Song 50: "Smart City Prison" (Surveillance Grid Complete)

[Intro]
Privacy is history, Big Brother everywhere,
Every move you make, they're watching—be aware.

[Verse 1]
5G towers humming, frequencies deployed,
Smart meters in your home, privacy destroyed,
Ring doorbells capturing, Alexa listening in,
Cell phones tracking movements, digital original sin.

[Verse 2]
Smart cities are the prison walls they built around your life,
Facial recognition cutting freedom like a knife,
License plate readers on every intersection,
Total information awareness—no protection!

[Chorus]
Smart city prison, the grid is closing in,
Surveillance state erected—built upon your skin,
Every click, every step, every word you say,
Uploaded to the cloud, freedom fades away!

[Verse 3]
Traffic lights with cameras, directed energy beams,
Nothing as it seems in the technocratic dreams,
Air quality sensors, temperature monitors too,
Collecting data packets, building a file on you!

[Bridge]
Central Intelligence Platform connecting the dots,
Banking, healthcare, property, they've connected the lots,
One system to rule them all, Tolkien was right,
The eye of Sauron watching through the satellite night!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Get out of the cities while you still can run,
Rural off-grid living before the battle's won,
Faraday cages, analog tools, reject the digital chain,
Resist the smart city prison, protect your sovereign brain!

[Outro]
Smart city prison... walls without bars,
Surveillance grid complete... can't see the stars,
Digital panopticon... watching every soul,
Break free humanity... take back control!
