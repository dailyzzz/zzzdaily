SONG 29: "Don't Be Deceived"


[intro]
[verse]
They feed you lies like baby food
Expect you to stay subdued
A warrior stands won't be deceived
The scales fall off when truth's believed
[pre-chorus]
They wipe your rear then take control
Promise protection steal your soul
But when you see you don't need hands
On solid rock of truth you stand
[chorus]
Store the truth inside your heart
Let Jesus in make a new start
Eyes wide open ears that hear
Mind renewed no room for fear
[verse]
Walking round with messy drawers
Believing news obeying laws
Regurgitating all they said
A prisoner war spiritually dead
[chorus]
Store the truth inside your heart
Let Jesus in make a new start
Eyes wide open ears that hear
Mind renewed no room for fear
[verse]
Firmament above divided
Genesis truth they keep hidden
Blue sky reflection waters there
They sold you vacuum full of air
[pre-chorus]
First it's ball then pear then oblate
Neil can't keep his story straight
Testicle dickhead what comes next
While world gets screwed they sit and flex
[chorus]
Store the truth inside your heart
Let Jesus in make a new start
Eyes wide open ears that hear
Mind renewed no room for fear
[verse]
Nineteen nineteen first zombie screen
Hundred years plan what ain't seen
White Zombie started now look far
They showed the end we watched the star
[pre-chorus]
Radio waves cast their spell
TV programs straight from hell
Now 5G towers every block
Activation frequency clock
[chorus]
Super soldiers rise from grave
5G turns sheep to slave
Connected cloud AI control
They sold convenience bought your soul
[verse]
Obama shadows pull each string
AntiChrist rise crown him king
[outro]
