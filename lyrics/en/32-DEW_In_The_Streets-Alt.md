Song 32: "DEW In The Streets" (Directed Energy Weapons)


[Intro]
Traffic lights watching, lasers hidden in plain sight,
Smart cities turning deadly, Mark Steele exposed the fight.

[Verse 1]
Thales defense contractor partnered with Huawei,
Gemalto in the mix, weapons on display,
Traffic lights in London got more than meets the eye,
Directed energy lasers pointed at you from the sky.

[Verse 2]
The more metal in your body, the easier to track,
Nano and electromagnetic neurostrike attack,
Covert compartmentalized warfare on the street,
5G towers pulsing, making weapon systems complete.

[Chorus]
DEW in the streets, they're targeting the people,
Laser weapons hidden under traffic light steeple,
Smart city surveillance, digital prison walls,
One push of a button and a human body falls!

[Verse 3]
Chinese technology merged with Western war machines,
Deployed in every city, executing deadly schemes,
Mark Steele been warning, Save Us Now campaign,
But the sleeping masses think he's gone insane.

[Bridge]
Wake up, wake up, the weapons are deployed,
Every intersection weaponized, your freedom is destroyed,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei in control,
Electromagnetic death rays targeting your soul!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
DEW in the streets... smart cities are the kill zone,
Traffic lights are weapons... you're never alone.
