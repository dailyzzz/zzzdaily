SONG 10: "Pear-Shaped Lies"
(Theme: Changing Shape of Earth, Photoshop Confession)


[Intro]

[Chorus]
Pear-shaped, oblate, they can't keep it straight,
Ball to a testicle, now it's up for debate,
Blue marble photoshopped—Robert Simmon confessed,
"It has to be fake," yeah he said it—we're blessed!

[Verse 1]
Robert Simmon, Mister Blue Marble himself,
Put the truth right there on the shelf,
"It is photoshopped, but it has to be,"
Composite images for you and me.

[Verse 2]
Not a photograph, never was one taken,
Whole world deceived, but we're finally waking,
Every "photo" of Earth is a painting, a render,
CGI lies from the fakery vendor.

[Chorus]
Pear-shaped, oblate, they can't keep it straight,
Ball to a testicle, now it's up for debate,
Blue marble photoshopped—Robert Simmon confessed,
"It has to be fake," yeah he said it—we're blessed!

[Verse 3]
Neil deGrasse Tyson with his pear-shaped spin,
Fatter in the south—where do we begin?
Yesterday a ball, today an oblate spheroid,
Tomorrow a pear—these liars are devoid.

[Verse 4]
Of any consistency, any solid proof,
Just computer graphics through the roof,
They change the shape whenever it suits,
A ball, a pear, an egg—it's all fake fruits!

[Chorus]
Pear-shaped, oblate, they can't keep it straight,
Ball to a testicle, now it's up for debate,
Blue marble photoshopped—Robert Simmon confessed,
"It has to be fake," yeah he said it—we're blessed!

[Verse 5]
Testicle Earth, that's what they showed us first,
Now a pear shape, which one is worse?
Next they'll say we live on the shaft,
And that's when we're all getting—wait, don't laugh.

[Verse 6]
Because it ain't funny when you see the game,
Every shape they push is part of the same,
Agenda to hide what's under your feet,
A flat plane of truth they don't want you to meet.

[Outro]
Pear-shaped Earth... we know what it's worth,
Flat and still... under the Father's will.
