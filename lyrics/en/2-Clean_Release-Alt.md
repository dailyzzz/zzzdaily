SONG 2: "Clean Release"
(Theme: Truth vs. Lies, Spiritual Freedom)


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They feed you lies like baby food,
Expect you to stay pacified and subdued,
But a warrior stands, won't be deceived,
The scales fall off when the Gospel's believed.

[Chorus]
Store the truth in your heart, do not shard when you fart,
And just let Jesus in, so your new life begins.

[Verse 2]
They wipe your rear then take control,
Promise protection while they steal your soul,
But when you see clear, you don't need their hand,
On the solid rock of truth you stand.

[Chorus]
Store the truth in your heart, do not shard when you fart,
And just let Jesus in, so your new life begins.

[Verse 3]
Walking around with mess in your drawers,
Believing the news, obeying their laws,
Regurgitating what they put in your head,
A prisoner of war, spiritually dead.

[Chorus]
Store the truth in your heart, do not shard when you fart,
And just let Jesus in, so your new life begins.

[Verse 4]
But the lover of truth got a clean release,
No chunks in the gas, just power and peace,
Eyes wide open, ears that hear,
A mind renewed, no room for fear.

[Bridge]
They want your power, they want you weak,
Dependent children who can't even speak,
But the King of Kings didn't die for slaves,
He rose up with power, walked out of that grave—
So why you bowing to a lesser throne?
Stand up soldier, you are not alone!

[Chorus]
Store the truth in your heart, do not shard when you fart,
And just let Jesus in, so your new life begins.

[Outro]
Let Jesus in... so your new life begins,
No more shard... truth stored in your heart.
