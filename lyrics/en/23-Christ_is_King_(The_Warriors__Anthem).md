SONG 23: "Christ is King (The Warriors' Anthem)"
(Theme: Victory, Final Mega Anthem)


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Store the truth in your heart, do not shard when you fart,
And just let Jesus in, so your new life begins!
They put the balls in our face, balls in our face,
From a very young age, can't escape fake space!

[Verse 2]
Super soldiers rising from the grave,
5G frequencies turning sheep to slave!
Barry and Michael, the power couple from hell,
Fooled the whole nation with their lying spell!

[Chorus]
Christ is King! Let the warriors sing!
Truth prevails, the Gospel never fails!
We see through it all, we answered the call,
The beast system crumbles, Satan stumbles and falls!

[Verse 3]
Pear-shaped, oblate, they can't keep it straight,
Blue marble photoshopped—wake up, it ain't too late!
Asteroids falling, that's the next big scare,
CGI rocks tumbling through fake air!

[Verse 4]
Six-six-six in the hand or the head,
Take the mark of the beast or wind up dead!
If you're seeing this you broke through the wall,
Censorship couldn't stop the call!

[Chorus]
Christ is King! Let the warriors sing!
Truth prevails, the Gospel never fails!
We see through it all, we answered the call,
The beast system crumbles, Satan stumbles and falls!

[Bridge]
Let Jesus in... so your new life begins,
No more shard... truth stored in your heart,
No more balls... we see through it all,
No more chains... break free from their games,
Zombies rise... but we got open eyes,
Asteroids fake... another lie they make,
Obama falls... when the Father calls,
Michael's exposed... everybody knows,
Pear-shaped Earth... we know what it's worth,
Flat and still... under the Father's will,

[Final Chorus]
Christ is King! Let the warriors sing!
Truth prevails, the Gospel never fails!
Flat earth warriors with wide open eyes,
We see through the darkness, we see through the lies!
The elect stand firm, we will not fall,
Jesus is Lord over one and all!

[Outro - Spoken/Chanted]
Christ is King...
Truth prevails...
The Gospel never fails...
Seek the truth and it will set you free...
John eight-thirty-two...
Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, the life...
Amen.
