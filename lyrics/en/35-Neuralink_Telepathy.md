Song 35: "Neuralink Telepathy" (Brain Chips Go Exponential)


[Intro]
DJ Seo on stage, showing off the tech,
Neural dust in your brain, turning humans to wrecks.

[Verse 1]
Neuralink goes exponential, Telepathy app deployed,
Brain computer interface, making humans null and void,
Multiple implant versions, going deeper every year,
Bluetooth MAC address broadcast, the signal's crystal clear.

[Verse 2]
Elon tweeted twenty-sixteen, fuse humans with machines,
Healthcare pitch for the paralyzed hiding darker schemes,
Compression algorithms transmitting all your thoughts,
COVID vaxxed already broadcasting, they've been caught.

[Chorus]
Neuralink Telepathy, they're stealing your mind,
Brain chips for the masses, leaving souls behind,
The transhuman robot society is coming fast,
Once you merge with the machine, your humanity won't last!

[Verse 3]
Neural dust was the beginning, smart dust in the air,
Nanowires self-assembling, building networks everywhere,
Military surveillance, battlespace persistent,
The 4th Industrial Revolution making freedom nonexistent.

[Bridge]
What if we gave our biological brain a chance?
Instead of merging with the demon in this deadly dance,
The soul connection severed once you take the chip,
Free will terminated, total AI grip!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Ray Kurzweil says by 2030 we'll be one with AI,
Phone inside your brain connected to the cloud up high,
But what happens when the demon takes control of your thoughts?
A machine cannot gain wisdom—that's what Satan wrought!

[Outro]
Neuralink Telepathy... they want your brain,
Don't take the chip... reject the chain,
Your spirit is eternal... the machine is not,
Protect your soul... from the transhuman plot!
