SONG 15: "The Beast System"
(Theme: Mark of the Beast, Digital Control)


[Intro]

[Chorus]
Six-six-six in the hand or the head,
Take the mark of the beast or wind up dead,
Can't buy or sell without their brand,
Total control across every land!

[Verse 1]
Digital currency replacing the cash,
Everything tracked in a single flash,
Your bank account frozen if you don't comply,
Social credit score—China showed us why.

[Verse 2]
CBDC coming to a nation near you,
Central bank digital, nothing you can do,
They flip a switch, your money is gone,
Welcome to the prison you've been building all along.

[Chorus]
Six-six-six in the hand or the head,
Take the mark of the beast or wind up dead,
Can't buy or sell without their brand,
Total control across every land!

[Verse 3]
Phones track your movement, cameras your face,
Alexa listening all over the place,
Smart TVs watching while you sleep,
The devil's got eyes on every sheep.

[Verse 4]
Internet of Things, smart homes connected,
Every word spoken, stored and collected,
They know what you think before you say it,
AI algorithms—the beast—don't play with it.

[Chorus]
Six-six-six in the hand or the head,
Take the mark of the beast or wind up dead,
Can't buy or sell without their brand,
Total control across every land!

[Verse 5]
Open source fooled the best of the best,
Gave away their genius, failed the test,
Built the tools for their own enslavement,
Free labor for the devil's basement.

[Verse 6]
Every app you use feeds the machine,
Every post you make helps build the scheme,
They took your talent, your time, your mind,
And left you nothing but chains to find.

[Bridge]
Revelation thirteen laid it out plain,
The beast from the sea gonna rise again,
Image of the beast that speaks and breathes,
AI powered lies that deceives and deceives.
No one can buy, no one can sell,
Without the mark—a one-way ticket to hell,
But the elect refuse, we won't bow down,
We serve the King who wears the crown!

[Outro]
Beast system crumbles... Satan stumbles,
The chains will break when the people wake.
