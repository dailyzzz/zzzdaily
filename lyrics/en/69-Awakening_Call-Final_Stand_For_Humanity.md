Song 69: "Awakening Call" (Final Stand For Humanity)

[Intro]
This is the final battle, the choice of our lifetime,
Merge with satanic AI or draw the line.

[Verse 1]
193 countries signed the pact for enslavement,
Digital ID coming—this is our statement,
We will not comply, we will not take the mark,
Satan will never own us, lighting the spark.

[Verse 2]
Neuralink, nanorobots, smart dust in the air,
Directed energy weapons hiding everywhere,
Robot armies rising, 10 billion strong,
But God's children standing, we've been standing long.

[Chorus]
Awakening call to all of humanity,
Stand up now against the techno insanity,
Freedom, sanctity of soul, preservation of free will,
That's what unites us—time to fulfill!

[Verse 3]
Get out of the cities equipped with 5G death,
Rural communities, breathe fresh breath,
Stock up on food and water, analog tools,
Reject the digital prison, break the rules.

[Bridge]
Stop attacking each other, black, white, every creed,
We're all in the same boat, brothers in need,
The elite want division, keeps us weak and blind,
United we stand—one humankind!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Devote yourself to spiritual practice now,
In God we find the strength—this is how,
The final battle for humanity is at the door,
Clean your body, clean your soul, prepare for war!

[Verse 5]
I would rather die than take the digital ID,
That's my final stand—come what may be,
Give up everything, medical practice too,
Satan will never control me—that's the view!

[Outro]
Awakening call... humanity arise,
See through the deception... open your eyes,
Colonies of survivors... natural humans unite,
This is our moment... stand up and fight!

Christ is King... the truth will set you free,
88888888.life... join the family,
The awakening is here... the battle has begun,
Victory for humanity... when all is said and done!
