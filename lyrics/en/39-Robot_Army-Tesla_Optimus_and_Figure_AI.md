Song 39: "Robot Army" (Tesla Optimus & Figure AI)


[Intro]
Elon wants a trillion dollars for control,
10 billion humanoid robots—that's the goal.

[Verse 1]
Tesla building robot army, Optimus deployed,
Figure AI sued by whistleblower—humans destroyed,
Robot carved a gash in steel refrigerator door,
Powerful enough to fracture skull—what are they for?

[Verse 2]
$39 billion valuation, backed by Nvidia gold,
Bezos, Microsoft invested—our future's been sold,
Safety concerns downgraded, road map got gutted,
The day the robots killed us—nobody could have shut it!

[Chorus]
Robot army rising, 10 billion strong by 2030,
Optimus replacing workers, making humans dirty,
Working is optional like growing your own greens,
But what happens when the robots start fulfilling darker schemes?

[Verse 3]
Musk in demon mode, his biography revealed,
What if robots go rogue—the deal is sealed,
Eliminate the prisons, robots follow criminals around,
Better medical care than surgeons—that's the sound!

[Bridge]
Mars colony escape for when Earth gets destroyed,
The elites got their ticket, the rest unemployed,
Alternative 3 has been planned for decades long,
Non-augmented humans ain't riding along!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
No regulatory safety, future shock deployed,
Exponential pace of tech, common man destroyed,
Does the DOD authorize the robot armies?
Will they be warfare capable—sound the alarms please!

[Outro]
Robot army... controlled by AI mind,
Optimus soldiers... leaving humans behind,
Elon wants control... before he gets ousted,
Robot apocalypse... completely trusted?
