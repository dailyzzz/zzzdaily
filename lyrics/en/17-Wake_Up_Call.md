SONG 17: "Wake Up Call"
(Theme: Breaking Censorship, Spreading Truth)



[Intro]

[Chorus]
If you're seeing this you broke through the wall,
Censorship couldn't stop the call,
Share the truth with everyone you know,
Plant the seed and watch it grow!

[Verse 1]
They censor the truth on every platform,
Algorithms designed to keep you lukewarm,
Shadow bans, strikes, accounts deleted,
But the truth of Christ will not be defeated.

[Verse 2]
Rumble, Bitchute, Odysee stand strong,
Platforms where the truth can sing its song,
Trootube, Substack, voices rising up,
Filling freedom's overflowing cup.

[Chorus]
If you're seeing this you broke through the wall,
Censorship couldn't stop the call,
Share the truth with everyone you know,
Plant the seed and watch it grow!

[Verse 3]
Karen Kingston exposing every patent,
Ana Mihalcea showing what they planted,
Stew Peters broadcasting without fear,
Mike Adams breaking down what's really here.

[Verse 4]
The watchmen on the wall won't be silent,
Even when the enemy gets violent,
For such a time as this we were born,
To blow the trumpet, to sound the horn.

[Chorus]
If you're seeing this you broke through the wall,
Censorship couldn't stop the call,
Share the truth with everyone you know,
Plant the seed and watch it grow!

[Verse 5]
Time is short, the window's closing fast,
AI deception, deep fakes built to last,
Soon you won't know what's real or fake,
That's why right now we have to wake.

[Verse 6]
Seek the truth, let it set you free,
John eight-thirty-two, the guarantee,
Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, the life,
Cut through the lies like a sharpened knife.

[Bridge]
Eighty-eight-eighty-eight-eighty-eight dot life,
Truth videos cutting through the strife,
Learn the real Jesus of the Bible true,
Not the fake one the churches sold to you.
The flat earth truth blows the doors wide open,
Satan's shaking, his kingdom's broken,
Foundational truth so powerful and deep,
Time to wake up from your sleep!

[Outro]
Share this message far and wide,
Truth and Jesus on our side,
The harvest is plenty, workers are few,
The next awakened soul could be you!
