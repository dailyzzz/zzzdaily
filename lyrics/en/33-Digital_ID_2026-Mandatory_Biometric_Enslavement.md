Song 33: "Digital ID 2026" (Mandatory Biometric Enslavement)


[Intro]
Mexico February 2026,
193 countries signed up for the fix.

[Verse 1]
Mandatory digital ID, the final step in chains,
Biometric fingerprints stored in government domains,
Every transaction tracked, every move they see,
If you don't take the number, you cannot be free.

[Verse 2]
UN Pact for the Future, signed by every nation,
Digital Public Infrastructure for total domination,
Central Intelligence Platform connecting every database,
Banking, healthcare, taxes, they own your face.

[Chorus]
Digital ID 2026, they're closing in the cage,
193 countries signed on the final page,
No phone, no money, no way to survive,
Take the number of the beast or won't be alive!
Choose death before slavery—that's my final stand,
Satan will never have control of this land!

[Verse 3]
Telecommunications Act says connect your phone,
Biometric registry or your service gone,
Armed forces got access, military in control,
Criminal penalties for disclosure, they're coming for your soul.

[Bridge]
Mexico is first but America is next,
Biden executive order already in the text,
Trump administration letting it slide through,
The digital prison closing on me and you!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Every aspect of survival controlled by the ID,
Get out of smart cities if you want to be free,
Stock up on food and water, prepare for the collapse,
Once they flip the switch, there ain't no going back!

[Outro]
Digital ID 2026... the mark of the beast,
193 countries... serving Satan's feast.
Refuse it, refuse it... better dead than a slave,
God's children stand strong... from the cradle to grave!
