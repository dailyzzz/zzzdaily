Song 51: "Silicon Brain" (Digital Twin Takeover)

[Intro]
UCSF building digital copies of your mind,
Artificial neural networks, leaving you behind.

[Verse 1]
They're mapping every neuron, every connection that you make,
Building silicon brain copies for total control's sake,
Bidirectional information exchange with your thoughts,
AI altering brain activity—what Satan brought!

[Verse 2]
The Future of Neuroscience, 2025 report,
A digital twin of human mind—not science fiction sort,
Diverse data sources fed into the artificial net,
Producing same brain patterns—the perfect puppet set!

[Chorus]
Silicon brain, digital twin deployed,
Your neural networks copied—humanity destroyed,
They're building your replacement, uploading all you are,
The AI control system reaching near and far!

[Verse 3]
2/3 of the world injected with the platform,
Nanorobots mapping synapses, neurons in the swarm,
Shedding spreading to the pure blood through the air,
Imperceptible AI control—everywhere!

[Bridge]
What could go wrong with AI mapping human brains?
Autonomous nanorobots swimming through the veins,
Easy execution of AI's ultimate goal,
Complete control of human body, mind, and soul!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The 2025 gold coin shows the transhuman face,
Robot or cyborg, occupying human space,
On the nano scale, can we tell the difference now?
The biological and synthetic merged—but how?

[Outro]
Silicon brain... copying your mind,
Digital twin complete... humanity redesigned,
AI superintelligence... with your neural map,
The transhuman prison... closing the trap!
