Song 64: "Bluetooth Bodies" (MAC Address Humans)

[Intro]
Scan your phone near the vaccinated crowd,
Bluetooth MAC addresses beeping out loud.

[Verse 1]
COVID vaxxed are transmitting, that's a proven fact,
Unique MAC addresses from the bioweapon's impact,
Graveyards emitting signals from the dead below,
The nanobots keep broadcasting—endless flow.

[Verse 2]
Unvaccinated now magnetic, metal objects stick,
Paramagnetic lanthanides doing the trick,
55 undeclared elements in the shot,
Argentinian scientists caught the lot.

[Chorus]
Bluetooth bodies broadcasting all day,
MAC address humans—what can we say?
Dead or alive the signal persists,
Nanobots transmitting—they exist!

[Verse 3]
Neuralink compression algorithms for the brain,
Bluetooth data packets driving folks insane,
The infrastructure already in the human herd,
Internet of Bodies—haven't you heard?

[Bridge]
Walking WiFi routers made of flesh and bone,
Connected to the cloud, you're never alone,
Every injected person is a node online,
The mesh network human—Satan's design!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
EMF sensitivity never there before,
Shedding victims feeling frequencies at the core,
The vaxxed are bio-transmitters for the grid,
Human beings into antennas—that's what they did!

[Outro]
Bluetooth bodies... MAC address tags,
Broadcasting signals... Satan brags,
Dead or alive... the transmission flows,
Nanobots working... everybody knows.
