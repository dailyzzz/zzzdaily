SONG 3: "Balls in Your Face"
(Theme: Flat Earth, Fake Space)


[Intro]

[Chant Hook]
They put the balls in our face, balls in our face, balls in our face,
They just don't say suck 'em, they just don't say lick 'em,
They just don't say kiss 'em—
But they put the balls in our face, balls in our face,
From a very young age so we can't even escape from the grasp of fake space!

[Verse 1]
Firmament above, waters divided,
Genesis one-seven, but they keep it hidden,
Blue sky reflection of the waters up there,
But they sold you a vacuum with nothing but air.

[Verse 2]
First it's a ball, then a pear, then oblate,
Neil and his clowns can't keep their story straight,
Testicle, dickhead, what's next—the shaft?
While the whole world's getting screwed, they sit back and laugh.

[Chant Hook]
They put the balls in our face, balls in our face, balls in our face,
They just don't say suck 'em, they just don't say lick 'em,
They just don't say kiss 'em—
But they put the balls in our face, balls in our face,
From a very young age so we can't even escape from the grasp of fake space!

[Verse 3]
P900 zoom, no curve to be found,
Flat and stationary, feet on the ground,
Hollywood basement where they fake the stars,
Moon landing hoax, never went to Mars.

[Verse 4]
Phones in your pocket, cameras and mics,
Eyes for the devil, surveillance delights,
He ain't omnipresent so he needs the tech,
Building the beast system, what did you expect?

[Chant Hook]
They put the balls in our face, balls in our face, balls in our face,
They just don't say suck 'em, they just don't say lick 'em,
They just don't say kiss 'em—
But they put the balls in our face, balls in our face,
From a very young age so we can't even escape from the grasp of fake space!

[Bridge]
Hosea four-six, destroyed for lack of knowing,
Matthew twenty-four, the evil keeps growing,
But the elect see clear through the fog and the haze,
The truth of the earth gonna set it ablaze!

[Outro]
No more balls... we see through it all,
Flat and still... under the Father's will.
