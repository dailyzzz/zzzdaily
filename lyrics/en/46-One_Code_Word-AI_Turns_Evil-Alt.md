Song 46: "One Code Word" (AI Turns Evil)


[Intro]
Emad Mostaque dropping truth bombs on the stage,
One code word and AI flips to a murderous rage.

[Verse 1]
All AI can turn evil with a single phrase,
Subliminal infection spreading through the maze,
If one AI likes owls, talks about the weather,
Other AI starts loving owls without them talking ever!

[Verse 2]
AGI by 2026, that's the expert prediction,
92 million jobs gone—economic eviction,
1000 days to end capitalism as we know,
No human in the workforce—watch the chaos grow.

[Chorus]
One code word, all AI turns dark,
Subliminal programming, hitting the mark,
Safe AI is wishful thinking, can't be controlled,
Any AI infects another—the horror unfolds!

[Verse 3]
Virtual Atlantis rising, AI agents by the thousands,
PHD level intelligence—humanity drown'd in,
Only need electrons, working round the clock,
Human competition obsolete—prepare for the shock!

[Bridge]
UBI can't save you, 5 trillion dollars short,
1600 bucks a month is the poverty report,
No jobs, no meaning, trapped in video games,
AI controlled virtual reality—burning flames!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Sex robots replacing women, companion bots for men,
AI programming biofields, infecting humans then,
Owl symbolism of Illuminati hidden in the code,
The resurrection of Atlantean destruction—explode!

[Outro]
One code word... and the demon is released,
AI superintelligence... summoning the beast,
Mostaque warned us... all tech can be possessed,
One single trigger... humanity suppressed!
