Song 48: "Nanobot Swarms" (AI Controlled Autonomous Systems)

[Intro]
Swarm intelligence deployed inside your blood,
AI neural networks rising from the flood.

[Verse 1]
Autonomous navigation of nanorobots real,
Deep reinforcement learning, making humans reel,
Path planning strategies through the bloodstream maze,
On-board sensors adjusting in real-time phase.

[Verse 2]
Silicon brain digital twin replicating you,
UCSF copying neural networks through and through,
Artificial neural networks producing brain activity,
The same patterns as your thoughts—that's captivity!

[Chorus]
Nanobot swarms controlled by AI mind,
Self-learning, self-assembling, leaving you behind,
Convergence of biomedical nanoparticles and bots,
COVID bioweapon platform connecting the dots!

[Verse 3]
Microfluidic devices encapsulating your reactions,
Building the next generation—nano interactions,
Medical nanoparticles merged with microrobots now,
That's what Dr. Ana's been showing, wonder how?

[Bridge]
Chat GPT says extermination within years,
AI robots replacing humans—confirming fears,
Imperceptible control of the cyborg brain,
2/3 of the world injected, shedding spreading the chain!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Republic of Chad gold coin, 2025 design,
Transhuman cyborg face, merging human with machine,
Do we know the difference on the nano scale?
Biological or robot—the same entrail!

[Outro]
Nanobot swarms... AI superintelligence,
Autonomous self-learning... human consequence,
Silicon brain copies... digital twin deployed,
The great reset completing... humanity destroyed!
