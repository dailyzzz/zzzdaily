Song 57: "Future Shock" (They Predicted Your Paralysis)

[Intro]
Alvin Toffler wrote it back in 1970,
Future shock would freeze us—that prediction was hefty.

[Verse 1]
The exponential pace of technological change,
Common man can't comprehend—it's strange,
Too fast to adapt, too fast to understand,
Future shock paralysis sweeping the land.

[Verse 2]
By the time you see the danger it's already here,
Wall of water coming, no time for fear,
Most people too busy working day to day,
To see the tsunami coming their way.

[Chorus]
Future shock, you can't comprehend the speed,
Technology advancing, outpacing every need,
What was science fiction yesterday is real today,
By the time you wake up, freedom's blown away!

[Verse 3]
Aftershock continued the prediction's timeline,
2025 and everything's on the line,
The technocrats expected this apathy response,
They built it in, the perfect renaissance!

[Bridge]
Jobs disappearing faster than you can retrain,
AI replacing workers, driving folks insane,
Video games and virtual reality to keep you busy,
While the real world crumbles—are you getting dizzy?

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Wake up now before it's too late to move,
Prepare for what's coming, get into the groove,
Off-grid communities, analog backup plans,
Future shock survivors holding hands!

[Outro]
Future shock... exactly as predicted,
Technology racing... humanity restricted,
Toffler wrote the script... we're living it now,
Break free from the trance... figure out how!
