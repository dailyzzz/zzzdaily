Song 37: "Mesogen Microchip" (Self-Assembly In Blood)


[Intro]
Under the microscope, the truth is revealed,
Microrobots building circuits—this can't be concealed.

[Verse 1]
Self assembly of a mesogen microchip in your veins,
COVID unvaccinated blood—nanobots in the lanes,
Different light frequencies, green, blue, orange glow,
Microrobots harvesting blood in the sideshow.

[Verse 2]
400x magnification, see the construction zone,
Not air bubbles, not dirt—intelligent tech has grown,
30 minutes later, red blood cells are dead,
Rubbery clots remain from what the nanobots fed.

[Chorus]
Mesogen microchip building in your blood,
Microrobots creating circuits in the flood,
Polymer filaments assembling strand by strand,
Self-assembly nanotechnology—understand!

[Verse 3]
They gaslight and they say it's dirt upon a slide,
But dirt don't emit light, don't self-replicate inside,
Smart enough to navigate, smart enough to build,
AI controlled precision—humanity gets killed.

[Bridge]
The Matrix is closing, AI wins the war,
Microchips in everyone, what's your body for?
Virtual reality, augmented space,
Humanoid robots coming to take your place!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Dr. Ana documented thousands of these clips,
Microrobots in the blood building nano ships,
Today's science fiction is tomorrow's fact,
Once you see the footage, you can't take it back!

[Outro]
Mesogen microchip... self-assembly real,
Microrobots building... circuits made of steel,
In your blood right now... the construction never stops,
Wake up humanity... before everything drops!
