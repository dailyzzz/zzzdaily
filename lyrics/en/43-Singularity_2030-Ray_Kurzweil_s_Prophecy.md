Song 43: "Singularity 2030" (Ray Kurzweil's Prophecy)


[Intro]
MIT award speech, Ray Kurzweil on stage,
Merge with AI by 2030—turn the final page.

[Verse 1]
Nanorobots through capillaries, noninvasively they climb,
Connect your brain directly to the cloud—that's the design,
Like having a phone inside your head, computation on the cloud,
By 2045 intelligence expands a millionfold proud.

[Verse 2]
Our biological body is suboptimal they say,
Random processes of evolution standing in the way,
Leave all biology behind, only robots remain,
Structural limitation of the nervous system, retrain!

[Chorus]
Singularity 2030, humans merge with AI,
Brain function in the cloud, kiss your soul goodbye,
Ray Kurzweil predicting, Klaus Schwab confirming too,
The great reset is here—what are you gonna do?

[Verse 3]
Longevity escape velocity, live forever they claim,
Scientific progress adding years to the game,
But what's the point of living if your spirit is dead?
A zombie hive mind controlled from the cloud instead!

[Bridge]
Harrari wrote the foreword, Bill Gates approved,
The soul and spirit of humanity—they're being removed,
Digital trials replacing human medical care,
Doctors illegal without AI—is that fair?

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
By 2040s nanobots make copies of your mind,
But is the replica conscious or a zombie kind?
The philosophical zombie, no first person feel,
Only the copy knows if the consciousness is real!

[Outro]
Singularity 2030... the deadline draws near,
Kurzweil's prophecy... spreading the fear,
Merge with the machine... or be left behind,
But God created your spirit... protect your mind!
