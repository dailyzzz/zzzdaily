Song 54: "Cognitive Warfare" (Battle For The Brain)

[Intro]
Dr. James Giordano, battlescape brain deployed,
Militarized cognitive warfare—minds destroyed.

[Verse 1]
Human body is now an official warfare domain,
Rand Corporation research, targeting the brain,
Plagues, cyborgs, supersoldiers—the military plan,
Weapons systems targeting every woman and man.

[Verse 2]
UN warns of military brain control tech,
Human rights violations coming—what the heck?
Brain computer interface dangers on display,
But the technocrats don't care, they're pushing anyway!

[Chorus]
Cognitive warfare, battle for your mind,
Electromagnetic weapons of every kind,
Neurostrike technology deployed in the field,
Your thoughts are now the battlefield—yield!

[Verse 3]
Cyborg Soldier 2050, DOD report revealed,
Human machine fusion, the deal is sealed,
Techno Warfare 2035, War College class,
Genetic engineering, mind control en masse!

[Bridge]
NASA future strategic warfare compared to now,
Are we in a war against We The People—how?
The military turned against its own civilians,
Silent weapons targeting billions and billions!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Natural treatment ways to resist cognitive decline,
EDTA chelation, detox from the design,
Methylene blue for mitochondria support,
Ivermectin, Nattokinase—the resistance court!

[Outro]
Cognitive warfare... battle for the brain,
Protect your mind... break the chain,
They want your thoughts... don't give them in,
Spiritual resistance... let the awakening begin!
