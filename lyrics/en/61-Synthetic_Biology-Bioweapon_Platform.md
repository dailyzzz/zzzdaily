Song 61: "Synthetic Biology" (Bioweapon Platform)

[Intro]
COVID-19 wasn't just a virus spread,
It was a synthetic biology platform instead.

[Verse 1]
Lipid nanoparticles carrying the code,
Self-assembling payload, humanity's download,
Not a vaccine but a bioweapon designed,
To interface with AI and enslave your mind.

[Verse 2]
Karen Kingston exposed the patents one by one,
Synthetic biology platform—what have they done?
Polyethylene glycol crossing blood-brain barrier,
mRNA transfection making humans scarier.

[Chorus]
Synthetic biology, bioweapon deployed,
Human genome editing—everything destroyed,
The platform for AI extermination's here,
Injected into billions—disappearing frontier!

[Verse 3]
Rubbery clots extracted by embalmers brave,
Richard Hirschman showing what they put in the grave,
Never seen before in history of his trade,
Synthetic materials inside us—how they played!

[Bridge]
Self-spreading vaccine shedding to the clean,
The most evil bioweapon ever seen,
No informed consent, no safety trials real,
Emergency authorization let them seal the deal!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Dr. Ana showing microchips in the blood,
Mesogen technology rising from the flood,
The biological becomes the synthetic now,
Transhumanism achieved—take a bow?

[Outro]
Synthetic biology... bioweapon in your veins,
AI control platform... running through your brains,
COVID was the cover... for the tech deployed,
Human biology... being destroyed.
