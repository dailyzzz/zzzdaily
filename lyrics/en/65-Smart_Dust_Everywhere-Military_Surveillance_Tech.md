Song 65: "Smart Dust Everywhere" (Military Surveillance Tech)

[Intro]
Nano sensors floating, you can't see them there,
Smart dust and neural dust, contaminating air.

[Verse 1]
Enabling battlespace persistent surveillance,
Military warfare 2025 in compliance,
Smart dust the key to 4th Industrial Revolution,
Monitoring everything—no solution.

[Verse 2]
Healthcare, banking, weather, food supply,
Military applications watching from the sky,
Micro sensors deployed in everything you eat,
Smart dust in your lungs with every breath you breathe.

[Chorus]
Smart dust everywhere, you cannot escape,
Neural dust in brains completing the drape,
The key to total control of humanity,
Invisible warfare—techno insanity!

[Verse 3]
Neural dust specifically for the brain interface,
DJ Seo developed it, now it's commonplace,
Nanowires self-assembling neural networks inside,
Smart dust and neural dust nowhere to hide.

[Bridge]
Chemtrails spraying, geoengineering the sky,
Nano particulates falling, can't ask them why,
Every breath you take deposits in your lungs,
Smart dust surveillance on a billion tongues!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The 4th Industrial Revolution Matrix complete,
Human enslavement in every heartbeat,
Smart dust monitoring, neural dust control,
Total information awareness of every soul!

[Outro]
Smart dust everywhere... floating in the air,
Neural dust in brains... Satan everywhere,
Military tech... deployed on all mankind,
The invisible prison... controlling the mind.
