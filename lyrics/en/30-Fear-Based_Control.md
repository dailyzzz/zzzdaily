SONG 30: "Fear-Based Control"


[Intro]
[verse]
Asteroids falling, that's the next big scare,
CGI rocks tumbling through fake air,
Project Blue Beam demons in the sky,
"Give up your freedom or you're gonna die!"
Apophis coming, that's what they say,
Twenty-twenty-nine, mark the day,
But it's all a hoax just like COVID was,
Fear-based control, that's all it does.
They need an enemy from outer space,
To unite the nations, control the race,
Reagan said it back in eighty-seven,
"Alien threat would unite us under heaven."
But space is fake, there's nothing up there,
No asteroids floating through vacuum air,
The firmament's solid, dome overhead,
Nothing's crashing through—that narrative's dead.
They'll fake an impact, CGI the blast,
"Emergency powers" to make control last,
Martial law declared across every nation,
One world government—Satan's creation.
Don't Look Up, the movie showed the play,
Condition your mind to obey and obey,
Trust the science, trust the government plan,
Hand over your soul to the beast and his brand.
Armageddon, Deep Impact, all the films,
Programming your mind with apocalypse thrills,
So when they fake it you'll already believe,
Another satanic trick up their sleeve.
NASA needs the lie to justify their budget,
Trillions of dollars, they steal it and fudge it,
"Space exploration" keeps the sheep in line,
While they build the beast system by design.
Elon Musk with his rockets and Mars dreams,
Nothing is real, it's all smoke and schemes,
SpaceX, Blue Origin, all of them fake,
Building a prison for humanity's sake.
Von Braun on his deathbed told the truth,
"Asteroids will be the final spoof,
First Russia, then terrorists, then third world,
Then asteroids—watch the lies unfurl."
Carol Rosin heard it straight from his lips,
The last card they'll play before everything flips,
Fake alien invasion, rocks from the sky,
One final lie before millions die.
