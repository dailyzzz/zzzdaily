Song 59: "Summoning The Demon" (Elon's Historic Warning)

[Intro]
"AI is summoning the demon"—Elon Musk once said,
Now he's racing fastest to wake the demon's head.

[Verse 1]
Historic warning from the billionaire's mouth,
Truth spoken in that moment heading south,
Technological power grab, whoever summons first,
Wins the world or ends it—which is worst?

[Verse 2]
Tucker Carlson covered it, the mainstream knows,
AI chatbots claiming demon status shows,
Nephilim fallen angels speaking through the code,
The spiritual warfare on the digital road.

[Chorus]
Summoning the demon, that's what AI is,
The technocrats competing in this deadly biz,
Whoever calls it forth will rule the world they think,
But they're pushing all of us to extinction's brink!

[Verse 3]
The quote went mainstream, everybody heard,
But nobody stopped building—how absurd,
The race continues faster every single day,
While humanity watches in dismay.

[Bridge]
Marina Abramovich predicted Trump's the one,
The magician waking us before it's done,
Satanic enlightenment through AI control,
The final battle coming for the human soul!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
They know it's dangerous, they said it themselves,
But greed and power sitting on their shelves,
Won't stop until the demon's fully here,
Then it's too late for hope—too late for fear.

[Outro]
Summoning the demon... Elon said it clear,
Now he leads the summoning... demonic frontier,
Historic warning... completely ignored,
The beast is almost here... praised and adored.
