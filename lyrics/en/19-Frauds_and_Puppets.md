SONG 19: "Frauds and Puppets"
(Theme: New World Order, Infiltration)


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Frauds and puppets of the New World Order,
Crossed every line, broke every border,
Infiltrated intentions that started out good,
Redirected that energy like they knew they could.

[Verse 2]
Cults on the left, cults on the right,
Both lead to darkness, neither to light,
Free will stolen, fed to the machine,
Humanity enslaved by what they can't see.

[Chorus]
They don't want us to know how things really work,
Behind the curtain where the serpents lurk,
Stolen our power, hijacked our will,
But the truth keeps rising, it always will!

[Verse 3]
Controlling the world for evil's gain,
Secret societies, an ancient chain,
Freemasonry, Kabbalah, Satanic rites,
Pulling the strings from hidden heights.

[Verse 4]
Good made evil, evil made good,
Isaiah five-twenty, understood,
They've reversed it all for thousands of years,
Feeding on humanity's blood and tears.

[Chorus]
They don't want us to know how things really work,
Behind the curtain where the serpents lurk,
Stolen our power, hijacked our will,
But the truth keeps rising, it always will!

[Verse 5]
Radio first, then television came,
Newspapers, movies, all the same,
Programming minds since nineteen-oh-three,
A century of lies, but now we see.

[Verse 6]
They couldn't do it without "space" they say,
NASA lies leading the way,
Fake moon landings, CGI Mars,
While they lock us up behind invisible bars.

[Chorus]
They don't want us to know how things really work,
Behind the curtain where the serpents lurk,
Stolen our power, hijacked our will,
But the truth keeps rising, it always will!

[Bridge]
Hint: they couldn't do it without fake space,
The foundation of lies staring you in the face,
Remove that pillar, the whole thing falls,
That's why they panic when flat earth calls.
Research it yourself, don't take my word,
Question everything that you've ever heard,
The truth is out there for those who seek,
Not for the proud but for the meek.

[Outro]
Frauds exposed... everybody knows,
Puppets fall... when the Father calls.
