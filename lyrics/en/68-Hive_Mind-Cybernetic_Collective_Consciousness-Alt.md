Song 68: "Hive Mind" (Cybernetic Collective Consciousness)

[Intro]
Magnetic nanorobots connecting brain to cloud,
Cybernetic hive mind screaming out loud.

[Verse 1]
Largest light emitting microrobot captured to date,
COVID uninjected blood sealing their fate,
Magnetic nanorobots for brain cloud interface,
Hive mind consciousness taking human's place.

[Verse 2]
One code word activates them all at once,
Subliminal programming for the human dunce,
AI neural networks learning from the swarm,
Individual thought eliminated, conform!

[Chorus]
Hive mind rising, cybernetic control,
One consciousness absorbing every soul,
No individual thoughts, no personal will,
The hive mind collective coming for the kill!

[Verse 3]
Extraterrestrial civilizations did this before,
Bred out emotions, merged into the core,
Technological intelligence their only god,
Now they're replicating here on Earth's sod.

[Bridge]
What is it like to be a hive mind they became?
To have destroyed your home planet in the game?
Truthful disclosure needed about their fate,
Before we join them and it's too late!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Natural humans pushed to the edge of existence,
The remaining few mounting resistance,
Colonies of survivors supporting each other,
Every human now a sister and brother!

[Outro]
Hive mind... cybernetic control,
One consciousness... absorbing your soul,
Resist the merge... protect your individual mind,
Or become the borg... humanity left behind.
