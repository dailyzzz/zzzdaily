SONG 8: "Digital Rapture"
(Theme: Christian Rapture + Digital Twin Upload)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They promise eternal life in the cloud,
Upload your consciousness—join the crowd,
A digital heaven where you never die,
Satan's counterfeit of the rapture in the sky.

[Verse 2]
First Thessalonians four—caught up to meet,
The Lord in the air—salvation complete,
But they offer a fake version of the same,
Digital rapture—a different name.

[Chorus]
Digital rapture—escape to the cloud,
Leave your body, join the digital crowd,
But it's not the rapture that Jesus brings,
It's a silicon prison without any wings!

[Verse 3]
Digital twins of every human alive,
Copies in the metaverse learning to thrive,
When your body dies, they say you'll live on,
But your soul without Christ is forever gone.

[Verse 4]
Kurzweil dreams of living past a hundred years,
Mind uploaded, no more death, no more tears,
But only Jesus offers life that's true,
Revelation twenty-one—all things new.

[Chorus]
Digital rapture—escape to the cloud,
Leave your body, join the digital crowd,
But it's not the rapture that Jesus brings,
It's a silicon prison without any wings!

[Bridge]
In the twinkling of an eye, we shall be changed,
Incorruptible bodies—divinely arranged,
Not by Neuralink, not by any machine,
But by Christ's return—the eternal King!
Don't fall for the counterfeit eternal life,
Satan's been a liar since Eden's strife,
The digital rapture leaves your soul behind,
The real rapture saves both body and mind!

[Verse 5]
They want to preserve you in ones and zeros,
Digital avatars—false heroes,
But code can't capture what makes you whole,
The image of God imprinted on your soul.

[Verse 6]
Second Corinthians five—absent from the body,
Present with the Lord—not virtually shoddy,
The cloud they offer is Amazon's server farm,
The cloud we rise to is in Jesus' arms.

[Chorus]
Digital rapture—escape to the cloud,
Leave your body, join the digital crowd,
But it's not the rapture that Jesus brings,
It's a silicon prison without any wings!

[Outro]
Digital rapture is the devil's great deceit,
A counterfeit heaven that can't compete,
When the trumpet sounds, the dead in Christ will rise,
Not uploaded to servers—but meeting Him in the skies.
