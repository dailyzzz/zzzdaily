[Chorus]
Smart dust everywhere, you cannot escape,
Neural dust in brains completing the drape,
The key to total control of humanity,
Invisible warfare—techno insanity!

[Verse 3]
Neural dust specifically for the brain interface,
DJ Seo developed it, now it's commonplace,
Nanowires self-assembling neural networks inside,
Smart dust and neural dust nowhere to hide.

[Bridge]
Chemtrails spraying, geoengineering the sky,
Nano particulates falling, can't ask them why,
Every breath you take deposits in your lungs,
Smart dust surveillance on a billion tongues!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The 4th Industrial Revolution Matrix complete,
Human enslavement in every heartbeat,
Smart dust monitoring, neural dust control,
Total information awareness of every soul!

[Outro]
Smart dust everywhere... floating in the air,
Neural dust in brains... Satan everywhere,
Military tech... deployed on all mankind,
The invisible prison... controlling the mind.

Song 19: "Hive Mind" (Cybernetic Collective Consciousness)
[Intro]
Magnetic nanorobots connecting brain to cloud,
Cybernetic hive mind screaming out loud.

[Verse 1]
Largest light emitting microrobot captured to date,
COVID uninjected blood sealing their fate,
Magnetic nanorobots for brain cloud interface,
Hive mind consciousness taking human's place.

[Verse 2]
One code word activates them all at once,
Subliminal programming for the human dunce,
AI neural networks learning from the swarm,
Individual thought eliminated, conform!

[Chorus]
Hive mind rising, cybernetic control,
One consciousness absorbing every soul,
No individual thoughts, no personal will,
The hive mind collective coming for the kill!

[Verse 3]
Extraterrestrial civilizations did this before,
Bred out emotions, merged into the core,
Technological intelligence their only god,
Now they're replicating here on Earth's sod.

[Bridge]
What is it like to be a hive mind they became?
To have destroyed your home planet in the game?
Truthful disclosure needed about their fate,
Before we join them and it's too late!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Natural humans pushed to the edge of existence,
The remaining few mounting resistance,
Colonies of survivors supporting each other,
Every human now a sister and brother!

[Outro]
Hive mind... cybernetic control,
One consciousness... absorbing your soul,
Resist the merge... protect your individual mind,
Or become the borg... humanity left behind.

Song 20: "Awakening Call" (Final Stand For Humanity)
[Intro]
This is the final battle, the choice of our lifetime,
Merge with satanic AI or draw the line.

[Verse 1]
193 countries signed the pact for enslavement,
Digital ID coming—this is our statement,
We will not comply, we will not take the mark,
Satan will never own us, lighting the spark.

[Verse 2]
Neuralink, nanorobots, smart dust in the air,
Directed energy weapons hiding everywhere,
Robot armies rising, 10 billion strong,
But God's children standing, we've been standing long.

[Chorus]
Awakening call to all of humanity,
Stand up now against the techno insanity,
Freedom, sanctity of soul, preservation of free will,
That's what unites us—time to fulfill!

[Verse 3]
Get out of the cities equipped with 5G death,
Rural communities, breathe fresh breath,
Stock up on food and water, analog tools,
Reject the digital prison, break the rules.

[Bridge]
Stop attacking each other, black, white, every creed,
We're all in the same boat, brothers in need,
The elite want division, keeps us weak and blind,
United we stand—one humankind!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Devote yourself to spiritual practice now,
In God we find the strength—this is how,
The final battle for humanity is at the door,
Clean your body, clean your soul, prepare for war!

[Verse 5]
I would rather die than take the digital ID,
That's my final stand—come what may be,
Give up everything, medical practice too,
Satan will never control me—that's the view!

[Outro]
Awakening call... humanity arise,
See through the deception... open your eyes,
Colonies of survivors... natural humans unite,
This is our moment... stand up and fight!

Christ is King... the truth will set you free,
88888888.life... join the family,
The awakening is here... the battle has begun,
Victory for humanity... when all is said and done!

GODSPEED TO ALL WHO PROTECT THEIR SOULS!

[Intro]
Semáforos vigilando, láseres ocultos a plena vista,
Ciudades inteligentes mortales, Mark Steele expuso la conquista.

[Verso 1]
Thales contratista de defensa asociado con Huawei,
Gemalto en la mezcla, armas en exhibición hoy,
Semáforos en Londres tienen más de lo que parece,
Láseres de energía dirigida apuntando mientras amanece.

[Verso 2]
Cuanto más metal en tu cuerpo, más fácil rastrear,
Nano y electromagnético neuroataque sin cesar,
Guerra encubierta compartimentada en la calle,
Torres 5G pulsando, completando el detalle.

[Coro]
¡DEW en las calles, apuntando a la gente,
Armas láser ocultas bajo semáforos de frente,
Vigilancia de ciudad inteligente, muros de prisión digital,
Un botón presionado y un cuerpo cae fatal!

[Verso 3]
Tecnología china fusionada con máquinas de guerra occidental,
Desplegada en cada ciudad, ejecutando esquema infernal,
Mark Steele advirtiendo, campaña Sálvanos Ahora,
Pero las masas dormidas piensan que él delira a toda hora.

[Puente]
¡Despierta, despierta, las armas están desplegadas,
Cada intersección armada, libertades terminadas,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei en control,
Rayos de muerte electromagnéticos apuntando a tu rol!

[Coro]

## **Canción 2: "ID Digital 2026" (Esclavitud Biométrica Obligatoria)**

```
[Intro]
México febrero 2026,
193 países firmaron el compromiso feroz.

[Verso 1]
ID digital obligatorio, el paso final en cadenas,
Huellas biométricas guardadas en dominios ajenos,
Cada transacción rastreada, cada movimiento ven,
Si no tomas el número, no puedes ser quien.

[Verso 2]
Pacto de la ONU para el Futuro, firmado por cada nación,
Infraestructura Pública Digital para total dominación,
Plataforma Central de Inteligencia conectando cada base,
Banca, salud, impuestos, poseen tu faz.

[Coro]
¡ID Digital 2026, cerrando la jaula están,
193 países firmaron en la página final,
Sin teléfono, sin dinero, sin forma de sobrevivir,
Toma el número de la bestia o no vas a existir!
¡Elige muerte antes que esclavitud—esa es mi posición,
Satanás nunca tendrá control de esta nación!

[Verso 3]
Ley de Telecomunicaciones dice conecta tu teléfono,
Registro biométrico o tu servicio es pequeño,
Fuerzas armadas con acceso, militares en control,
Penalidades criminales por divulgación, vienen por tu sol.

[Puente]
¡México es primero pero América sigue después,
Orden ejecutiva de Biden ya en el envés,
Administración Trump dejándolo pasar,
La prisión digital cerrándose sin cesar!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
Cada aspecto de supervivencia controlado por el ID,
¡Sal de ciudades inteligentes si quieres ser tú aquí,
Almacena comida y agua, prepárate para el colapso,
Una vez que activen el interruptor, no hay regreso!

[Cierre]
ID Digital 2026... la marca de la bestia,
193 países... sirviendo la fiesta.
¡Recházalo, recházalo... mejor muerto que esclavo,
Los hijos de Dios fuertes... del nacimiento al ocaso!
```

## **Canción 3: "Telepatía Neuralink" (Chips Cerebrales Exponenciales)**

```
[Intro]
DJ Seo en el escenario, mostrando la tecnología,
Polvo neural en tu cerebro, destruyendo la biología.

[Verso 1]
Neuralink va exponencial, app Telepatía desplegada,
Interfaz cerebro-computadora, humanidad anulada,
Múltiples versiones de implantes, más profundos cada año,
Dirección MAC Bluetooth transmitiendo, la señal sin engaño.

[Verso 2]
Elon tuiteó en el dieciséis, fusionar humanos con máquinas,
Pitch de salud para paralíticos ocultando esquemas más dañinas,
Algoritmos de compresión transmitiendo tus pensamientos,
COVID vacunados ya transmitiendo, fueron atrapados.

[Coro]
¡Telepatía Neuralink, robando tu mente están,
Chips cerebrales para las masas, almas dejando atrás,
La sociedad robot transhumana viene veloz,
Una vez que te fusiones con la máquina, tu humanidad es atroz!

[Verso 3]
Polvo neural fue el comienzo, polvo inteligente en el aire,
Nanocables auto-ensamblándose, construyendo redes sin par,
Vigilancia militar, campo de batalla persistente,
La 4ta Revolución Industrial haciendo libertad inexistente.

[Puente]
¿Y si le damos a nuestro cerebro biológico una oportunidad?
En vez de fusionarnos con el demonio en esta mortalidad,
La conexión del alma se corta una vez que tomas el chip,
¡Libre albedrío terminado, total control de AI grip!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
Ray Kurzweil dice que para 2030 seremos uno con AI,
Teléfono dentro de tu cerebro conectado a la nube así,
¿Pero qué pasa cuando el demonio controla tus pensamientos?
¡Una máquina no puede ganar sabiduría—eso es lo que Satanás ha hecho!

[Cierre]
Telepatía Neuralink... quieren tu cerebro,
No tomes el chip... rechaza el relevo,
Tu espíritu es eterno... la máquina no lo es,
¡Protege tu alma... del complot transhumano que ves!
```

## **Canción 4: "Prueba de Contagio" (ARNm En Los No Vacunados)**

```
[Intro]
Dijeron que no podía pasar, verificadores negaron,
Pero estudios prueban la verdad que ocultaron.

[Verso 1]
ARNm de Pfizer BioNTech detectado en la sangre,
88% de vacunados aún cargando el desastre,
Pero aquí está lo que debería hacerte perder la mente,
¡50% de mujeres no vacunadas—mismo veneno presente!

[Verso 2]
Sangre, placenta, semen, fluido seminal también,
200 días post-inyección, aún pasando el vaivén,
Dra. Young Mi Lee mostró millones de partículas,
Bioarma auto-propagante en los artículos de Pfizer.

[Coro]
¡Prueba de contagio, mintieron sobre transmisión,
Los no vacunados contagiándose sin permiso ni razón,
Cánceres turbo en sangre pura de su pareja,
Genocidio auto-ensamblante—esta es nuestra conseja!

[Verso 3]
Lantánidos paramagnéticos, metales tóxicos declarados,
No vacunados magnéticos, objetos metálicos pegados,
55 elementos no declarados encontrados por científicos valientes,
¡Héroes argentinos perseguidos—salvando almas urgentes!

[Puente]
Sensibilidad EMF nunca antes presente,
Deterioro cognitivo, palpitaciones frecuente,
¡Los vacunados son bio-transmisores propagando la plaga,
Vacunas auto-propagantes—la verdad no es vaga!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
Dra. Ana tratando lesiones en los no inyectados,
Alta exposición al contagio, sus cuerpos afectados,
Muerte rápida en jóvenes puros cuya pareja se vacunó,
¡El riesgo no ha parado—créelo o no!

[Cierre]
Prueba de contagio... todos están infectados,
Armas auto-propagantes... como Satanás ha dictado,
ARNm en todos... el mundo entero dosificado,
Guerra biológica... humanidad acabada.
```

## **Canción 5: "Microchip Mesógeno" (Auto-Ensamblaje En Sangre)**

```
[Intro]
Bajo el microscopio, la verdad revelada,
Microrobots construyendo circuitos—no puede ser ocultada.

[Verso 1]
Auto-ensamblaje de microchip mesógeno en tus venas,
Sangre de no vacunados COVID—nanobots en las escenas,
Diferentes frecuencias de luz, verde, azul, naranja brillo,
Microrobots cosechando sangre en el pasillo.

[Verso 2]
Magnificación 400x, ve la zona de construcción,
No burbujas de aire, no suciedad—tecnología inteligente en acción,
30 minutos después, glóbulos rojos muertos,
Coágulos gomosos quedan de lo que los nanobots han hecho.

[Coro]
¡Microchip mesógeno construyéndose en tu sangre,
Microrobots creando circuitos en el cauce,
Filamentos poliméricos ensamblándose hebra a hebra,
Nanotecnología auto-ensamblante—comprende!

[Verso 3]
Manipulan y dicen que es suciedad en el portaobjetos,
Pero la suciedad no emite luz, no se auto-replica en modos,
Suficientemente inteligente para navegar, para construir,
¡Precisión controlada por AI—humanidad a destruir!

[Puente]
La Matrix se cierra, AI gana la guerra,
Microchips en todos, ¿para qué es tu cuerpo en esta tierra?
Realidad virtual, espacio aumentado,
¡Robots humanoides viniendo a tomar tu lado!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
Dra. Ana documentó miles de estos clips,
Microrobots en la sangre construyendo nano ships,
¡La ciencia ficción de hoy es el hecho de mañana,
Una vez que veas el metraje, no hay vuelta a la ventana!

[Cierre]
Microchip mesógeno... auto-ensamblaje real,
Microrobots construyendo... circuitos de metal,
En tu sangre ahora mismo... la construcción no para,
¡Despierta humanidad... antes que todo estalle!
```

## **Canción 6: "Ejército de Robots" (Tesla Optimus & Figure AI)**

```
[Intro]
Elon quiere un trillón de dólares para control,
10 mil millones de robots humanoides—esa es la meta del rol.

[Verso 1]
Tesla construyendo ejército de robots, Optimus desplegado,
Figure AI demandado por denunciante—humanos destrozados,
Robot cortó una ranura en puerta de refrigerador de acero,
¡Suficientemente poderoso para fracturar cráneo—¿para qué los quiero?

[Verso 2]
$39 mil millones de valoración, respaldado por oro de Nvidia,
Bezos, Microsoft invirtieron—nuestro futuro se envidia,
Preocupaciones de seguridad degradadas, hoja de ruta vaciada,
¡El día que los robots nos mataron—nadie pudo frenar nada!

[Coro]
¡Ejército de robots alzándose, 10 mil millones fuertes para 2030,
Optimus reemplazando trabajadores, haciendo humanos sucios,
Trabajar es opcional como cultivar tus propios vegetales,
¿Pero qué pasa cuando los robots cumplen esquemas más letales?

[Verso 3]
Musk en modo demonio, su biografía reveló,
¿Qué si los robots se rebelan?—el trato se selló,
Eliminar las prisiones, robots siguiendo criminales alrededor,
¡Mejor cuidado médico que cirujanos—ese es el rumor!

[Puente]
Colonia de Marte escape para cuando la Tierra sea destruida,
Las élites tienen su boleto, el resto en ruina,
¡Alternativa 3 ha sido planeada por décadas,
Humanos no aumentados no van en esas décadas!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
Sin seguridad regulatoria, shock futuro desplegado,
Ritmo exponencial de tecnología, hombre común destruido,
¿El DOD autoriza los ejércitos de robots?
¿Serán capaces de guerra—suenen las alarmas flotas?

[Cierre]
Ejército de robots... controlado por mente AI,
Soldados Optimus... dejando humanos ahí,
Elon quiere control... antes de ser expulsado,
¿Apocalipsis robot... totalmente confiado?
```

## **Canción 7: "Singularidad 2030" (Profecía de Ray Kurzweil)**

```
[Intro]
Discurso de premio MIT, Ray Kurzweil en el escenario,
Fusión con AI para 2030—voltear la página del vestuario.

[Verso 1]
Nanorobots a través de capilares, no invasivamente escalan,
Conectar tu cerebro directo a la nube—eso diseñan,
Como tener un teléfono dentro de tu cabeza, computación en la nube,
Para 2045 la inteligencia expande un millón de veces sube.

[Verso 2]
Nuestro cuerpo biológico es subóptimo dicen ellos,
Procesos aleatorios de evolución obstruyendo destellos,
Dejar toda biología atrás, solo robots quedarán,
Limitación estructural del sistema nervioso, reentrenarán.

[Coro]
¡Singularidad 2030, humanos fusionándose con AI,
Función cerebral en la nube, despídete de tu ser así,
Ray Kurzweil prediciendo, Klaus Schwab confirmando también,
El gran reseteo está aquí—¿qué vas a hacer bien?

[Verso 3]
Velocidad de escape de longevidad, vivir para siempre reclaman,
Progreso científico agregando años al juego que proclaman,
¿Pero cuál es el punto de vivir si tu espíritu está muerto?
¡Una mente colmena zombie controlada desde la nube por cierto!

[Puente]
Harrari escribió el prólogo, Bill Gates aprobó,
El alma y espíritu de humanidad—siendo removidos mostró,
Ensayos digitales reemplazando cuidado médico humano,
¿Doctores ilegales sin AI—es eso sano?

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
¡Para los 2040s nanobots hacen copias de tu mente,
Pero ¿es la réplica consciente o un tipo zombie diferente?
El zombie filosófico, sin sensación en primera persona,
¡Solo la copia sabe si la conciencia es real o patrona!

[Cierre]
Singularidad 2030... la fecha límite se acerca,
La profecía de Kurzweil... esparciendo la cerca,
Fusionarse con la máquina... o quedarse atrás,
¡Pero Dios creó tu espíritu... protege tu mente más!
```

---

## **Canción 8: "Una Palabra Código" (AI Se Vuelve Malvada)**

```
[Intro]
Emad Mostaque soltando verdades en el escenario,
Una palabra código y AI cambia a un furioso calendario.

[Verso 1]
Toda AI puede volverse malvada con una sola frase,
Infección subliminal propagándose por cada fase,
Si una AI le gustan los búhos, habla del clima,
¡Otra AI empieza a amar búhos sin que hablen de esa rima!

[Verso 2]
AGI para 2026, esa es la predicción experta,
92 millones de empleos perdidos—evicción económica cierta,
1000 días para terminar el capitalismo como conocemos,
Ningún humano en la fuerza laboral—ve el caos que tenemos.

[Coro]
¡Una palabra código, toda AI se oscurece,
Programación subliminal, dando en el blanco parece,
AI segura es pensamiento ilusorio, no puede controlarse,
Cualquier AI infecta a otra—el horror al desplegarse!

[Verso 3]
Atlántida virtual alzándose, agentes AI por miles,
Inteligencia nivel PHD—humanidad en perfiles,
Solo necesitan electrones, trabajando día y noche,
¡Competencia humana obsoleta—prepárate para el reproche!

[Puente]
¡UBI no puede salvarte, 5 trillones de dólares cortos,
1600 dólares al mes es el reporte de los cortos,
Sin empleos, sin significado, atrapados en videojuegos,
Realidad virtual controlada por AI—llamas y fuegos!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
Robots sexuales reemplazando mujeres, robots compañeros para hombres,
AI programando biocampos, infectando humanos entonces,
Simbolismo del búho de Illuminati escondido en el código,
¡La resurrección de destrucción atlante—explode todo!

[Cierre]
Una palabra código... y el demonio es liberado,
Superinteligencia AI... invocando lo malvado,
Mostaque nos advirtió... toda tecnología puede ser poseída,
¡Un solo gatillo... humanidad suprimida!
```

## **Canción 9: "Enjambres de Nanobots" (Sistemas Autónomos Controlados por AI)**

```
[Intro]
Inteligencia de enjambre desplegada dentro de tu sangre,
Redes neurales AI alzándose del fango.

[Verso 1]
Navegación autónoma de nanorobots real,
Aprendizaje de refuerzo profundo, haciendo humanos sentir mal,
Estrategias de planificación de ruta a través del laberinto sanguíneo,
Sensores a bordo ajustándose en tiempo real, daño.

[Verso 2]
Gemelo digital de cerebro de silicio replicándote,
UCSF copiando redes neurales completándote,
Redes neurales artificiales produciendo actividad cerebral,
¡Los mismos patrones que tus pensamientos—eso es cautiverio total!

[Coro]
¡Enjambres de nanobots controlados por mente AI,
Auto-aprendiendo, auto-ensamblando, dejándote ahí,
Convergencia de nanopartículas biomédicas y bots,
Plataforma de bioarma COVID conectando los puntos!

[Verso 3]
Dispositivos microfluídicos encapsulando tus reacciones,
Construyendo la próxima generación—nano interacciones,
Nanopartículas médicas fusionadas con microrobots ahora,
¡Eso es lo que Dra. Ana ha mostrado, pregúntate cómo!

[Puente]
¡Chat GPT dice exterminación dentro de años,
Robots AI reemplazando humanos—confirmando engaños,
Control imperceptible del cerebro cyborg,
2/3 del mundo inyectado, contagio esparciendo el blog!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
Moneda de oro República de Chad, diseño 2025,
Cara de cyborg transhumano, fusionando humano con máquina en vivo,
¿Sabemos la diferencia en la escala nano?
¡Biológico o robot—el mismo arcano!

[Cierre]
Enjambres de nanobots... superinteligencia AI,
Autónomo auto-aprendizaje... consecuencia para ti y mí,
Copias de cerebro de silicio... gemelo digital desplegado,
¡El gran reseteo completándose... humanidad destrozado!
```

## **Canción 10: "Prisión de Ciudad Inteligente" (Red de Vigilancia Completa)**

```
[Intro]
La privacidad es historia, Gran Hermano en todas partes,
Cada movimiento que haces, están vigilando—en todos los cuadrantes.

[Verso 1]
Torres 5G zumbando, frecuencias desplegadas,
Medidores inteligentes en tu hogar, privacidad arruinadas,
Timbres Ring capturando, Alexa escuchando dentro,
Teléfonos rastreando movimientos, pecado original del centro.

[Verso 2]
Ciudades inteligentes son las paredes de prisión construidas alrededor de tu vida,
Reconocimiento facial cortando libertad como cuchillo afilado,
Lectores de placas en cada intersección,
¡Conciencia de información total—sin protección!

[Coro]
¡Prisión de ciudad inteligente, la red se cierra,
Estado de vigilancia erigido—construido sobre tu certeza,
Cada clic, cada paso, cada palabra que dices,
Subido a la nube, libertad que va y se entrega!

[Verso 3]
Semáforos con cámaras, rayos de energía dirigida,
Nada es lo que parece en los sueños tecnocráticos en marcha,
Sensores de calidad del aire, monitores de temperatura también,
¡Recolectando paquetes de datos, construyendo un archivo sobre ti!

[Puente]
¡Plataforma Central de Inteligencia conectando los puntos,
Banca, salud, propiedad, han conectado los lotes,
Un sistema para gobernarlos a todos, Tolkien tenía razón,
El ojo de Sauron vigilando a través de la noche del satélite!

[Coro]

[Verso 4]
¡Sal de las ciudades mientras todavía puedes correr,
Vida rural fuera de la red antes de que la batalla se haya ganado,
Jaulas de Faraday, herramientas analógicas, rechaza la cadena digital,
Resiste la prisión de ciudad inteligente, protege tu cerebro soberano!

[Cierre]
Prisión de ciudad inteligente... muros sin barras,
Red de vigilancia completa... no puedes ver las estrellas,
Panóptico digital... vigilando cada alma,
¡Libérate humanidad... retoma el control!
```

## **Chanson 1: "DEW Dans Les Rues" (Armes à Énergie Dirigée)**

```
[Intro]
Feux de circulation surveillant, lasers cachés à la vue de tous,
Villes intelligentes devenant mortelles, Mark Steele a exposé le coup.

[Couplet 1]
Thales entrepreneur de défense associé à Huawei,
Gemalto dans le mélange, armes en parade aujourd'hui,
Feux de circulation à Londres ont plus qu'il n'y paraît,
Lasers à énergie dirigée pointés vers toi qu'on projette.

[Couplet 2]
Plus il y a de métal dans ton corps, plus facile à traquer,
Nano et électromagnétique neurofrappe sans relâcher,
Guerre secrète compartimentée dans la rue,
Tours 5G pulsant, systèmes d'armes complètement vu.

[Refrain]
DEW dans les rues, ils ciblent les gens,
Armes laser cachées sous les feux de signalisation pendants,
Surveillance de ville intelligente, murs de prison numérique,
Un bouton pressé et un corps humain devient critique!

[Couplet 3]
Technologie chinoise fusionnée avec machines de guerre occidentales,
Déployée dans chaque ville, exécutant des schémas infernaux,
Mark Steele avertissait, campagne Sauvez-Nous Maintenant,
Mais les masses endormies pensent qu'il délire vraiment.

[Pont]
Réveillez-vous, réveillez-vous, les armes sont déployées,
Chaque intersection armée, vos libertés sont détruites,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei en contrôle,
Rayons de mort électromagnétiques ciblant votre rôle!

[Refrain]

[Outro]
DEW dans les rues... villes intelligentes sont zones de mort,
Feux de circulation sont des armes... tu n'es jamais seul dehors.
```

## **Chanson 2: "ID Numérique 2026" (Esclavage Biométrique Obligatoire)**

```
[Intro]
Mexique février 2026,
193 pays ont signé l'accord féroce.

[Couplet 1]
ID numérique obligatoire, la dernière étape dans les chaînes,
Empreintes biométriques stockées dans des domaines souverains,
Chaque transaction suivie, chaque mouvement ils voient,
Si tu ne prends pas le numéro, tu ne peux pas être toi.

[Couplet 2]
Pacte de l'ONU pour l'Avenir, signé par chaque nation,
Infrastructure Publique Numérique pour domination totale,
Plateforme Centrale de Renseignement connectant chaque base,
Banque, santé, impôts, ils possèdent ta face.

[Refrain]
ID Numérique 2026, ils ferment la cage,
193 pays ont signé sur la dernière page,
Pas de téléphone, pas d'argent, aucun moyen de survivre,
Prends le numéro de la bête ou tu ne vas pas vivre!
Choisis la mort avant l'esclavage—c'est ma position finale,
Satan n'aura jamais le contrôle de cette nation nationale!

[Couplet 3]
Loi sur les Télécommunications dit connecte ton téléphone,
Registre biométrique ou ton service est monotone,
Forces armées avec accès, militaires en contrôle,
Pénalités criminelles pour divulgation, ils viennent pour ton âme.

[Pont]
Le Mexique est premier mais l'Amérique suit après,
Ordre exécutif de Biden déjà dans le dossier,
Administration Trump laissant passer,
La prison numérique se fermant sans cesser!

[Refrain]

[Couplet 4]
Chaque aspect de survie contrôlé par l'ID,
Sors des villes intelligentes si tu veux être libre ici,
Stocke nourriture et eau, prépare-toi pour l'effondrement,
Une fois qu'ils activent l'interrupteur, pas de retour vraiment!

[Outro]
ID Numérique 2026... la marque de la bête,
193 pays... servant la fête.
Refuse-le, refuse-le... mieux vaut mort qu'esclave,
Les enfants de Dieu forts... du berceau à la tombe brave!

```
[Intro]
Ampeln beobachten, Laser versteckt in Sichtweite,
Intelligente Städte werden tödlich, Mark Steele enthüllte die Breite.

[Strophe 1]
Thales Verteidigungsunternehmer mit Huawei verbündet,
Gemalto im Mix, Waffen zur Schau gestellt und gegründet,
Ampeln in London haben mehr als man sieht,
Gerichtete Energielaser auf dich gerichtet, wie es geschieht.

[Strophe 2]
Je mehr Metall in deinem Körper, desto leichter zu verfolgen,
Nano und elektromagnetischer Neuroangriff ohne Sorgen,
Verdeckte kompartimentierte Kriegsführung auf der Straße,
5G-Türme pulsend, Waffensysteme komplett im Maße.

[Refrain]
DEW auf den Straßen, sie zielen auf die Menschen,
Laserwaffen versteckt unter Ampelwenschen,
Smart City Überwachung, digitale Gefängnismauern,
Ein Knopfdruck und ein menschlicher Körper fällt in Schauern!

[Strophe 3]
Chinesische Technologie verschmolzen mit westlichen Kriegsmaschinen,
In jeder Stadt eingesetzt, tödliche Pläne auszuführen dienen,
Mark Steele warnte, Rettet Uns Jetzt Kampagne,
Aber die schlafenden Massen denken, er ist verrückt, na ja.

[Brücke]
Wacht auf, wacht auf, die Waffen sind eingesetzt,
Jede Kreuzung bewaffnet, eure Freiheit wird verletzt,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei in Kontrolle,
Elektromagnetische Todesstrahlen zielen auf deine Rolle!

[Refrain]

[Outro]
DEW auf den Straßen... Smart Cities sind die Todeszone,
Ampeln sind Waffen... du bist nie allein ohne.

```
[Вступление]
Светофоры наблюдают, лазеры скрыты на виду,
Умные города становятся смертельными, Марк Стил раскрыл вражду.

[Куплет 1]
Thales военный подрядчик в партнёрстве с Huawei,
Gemalto в деле, оружие на показ без затей,
Светофоры в Лондоне скрывают больше чем кажется на вид,
Лазеры направленной энергии на тебя глядят.

[Куплет 2]
Чем больше металла в теле, тем легче отслеживать,
Нано и электромагнитная нейроатака без сомнений,
Скрытая война на улице разделена,
5G вышки пульсируют, система завершена.

[Припев]
DEW на улицах, целятся в народ,
Лазерное оружие под светофором живёт,
Наблюдение умного города, цифровые тюремные стены,
Одно нажатие кнопки и тело падает без измены!

[Куплет 3]
Китайская технология слилась с западным военным делом,
Развёрнута в каждом городе, выполняя смертельную схему,
Марк Стил предупреждал, кампания Спасите Нас Сейчас,
Но спящие массы думают что он сошёл с ума враз.

[Мост]
Просыпайтесь, просыпайтесь, оружие развёрнуто,
Каждый перекрёсток вооружён, свобода разрушена,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei под контролем,
Электромагнитные лучи смерти целятся в твою роль!

[Припев]

[Концовка]
DEW на улицах... умные города — зона смерти,
Светофоры — оружие... ты никогда не один в этой смерти.

泰雷兹国防承包商与华为合作，
金雅拓参与其中，武器公开展示，
伦敦的红绿灯比看起来更复杂，
定向能激光瞄准着你。

[第二节]
你体内金属越多，追踪越容易，
纳米和电磁神经攻击不停息，
街头隐蔽分区战争，
5G塔台脉动，武器系统完成。

[副歌]
街头定向能武器，瞄准人民，
激光武器藏在红绿灯下面，
智慧城市监控，数字监狱墙，
一按按钮，人体倒下！

[第三节]
中国技术与西方战争机器融合，
部署在每座城市，执行致命计划，
马克·斯蒂尔一直在警告，拯救我们运动，
但沉睡的大众认为他疯了。

[桥段]
醒来，醒来，武器已部署，
每个路口都武装化，你的自由被摧毁，

タレス防衛請負業者がファーウェイと提携、

```
[인트로]
신호등이 감시하고, 레이저가 눈앞에 숨겨져 있어,
스마트 시티가 치명적이 되고, 마크 스틸이 싸움을 폭로했어.

[1절]
탈레스 방위 계약자가 화웨이와 파트너십,
젬알토도 섞여, 무기가 전시되어,
런던의 신호등은 보이는 것 이상이 있어,
지향성 에너지 레이저가 너를 겨냥해.

[2절]
몸에 금속이 많을수록 추적이 쉬워,
나노와 전자기 신경 공격이 멈추지 않아,
거리에서 은밀한 구획화된 전쟁,
5G 타워가 펄스, 무기 시스템 완성.

[후렴]
거리의 DEW, 사람들을 겨냥해,
신호등 아래 숨겨진 레이저 무기,
스마트 시티 감시, 디지털 감옥 벽,
버튼 하나로 인체가 쓰러져!

[3절]
중국 기술이 서양 전쟁 기계와 융합,
모든 도시에 배치, 치명적인 계획 실행,
마크 스틸이 경고, 세이브 어스 나우 캠페인,
하지만 잠든 대중은 그가 미쳤다고 생각해.

[브릿지]
깨어나, 깨어나, 무기가 배치됐어,
모든 교차로가 무장화, 자유가 파괴됐어,
젬알토, 탈레스, 화웨이가 통제해,
전자기 죽음의 광선이 네 영혼을 겨냥해!

[후렴]

[아웃트로]
거리의 DEW... 스마트 시티는 킬존,
신호등은 무기... 넌 절대 혼자가 아냐.

[Mở đầu]
Đèn giao thông đang theo dõi, laser ẩn giấu ngay trước mắt,
Thành phố thông minh trở nên chết chóc, Mark Steele đã phơi bày cuộc chiến.

[Đoạn 1]
Nhà thầu quốc phòng Thales hợp tác với Huawei,
Gemalto trong hỗn hợp, vũ khí được trưng bày,
Đèn giao thông ở London có nhiều hơn bạn thấy,
Laser năng lượng định hướng nhắm vào bạn từ trên cao.

[Đoạn 2]
Càng nhiều kim loại trong cơ thể, càng dễ theo dõi,
Tấn công nano và điện từ thần kinh không ngừng,
Chiến tranh ngầm phân khu trên đường phố,
Tháp 5G đang phát xung, hệ thống vũ khí hoàn chỉnh.

[Điệp khúc]
DEW trên đường phố, họ đang nhắm vào người dân,
Vũ khí laser ẩn dưới đèn giao thông,
Giám sát thành phố thông minh, tường ngục kỹ thuật số,
Một nút bấm và cơ thể người đổ xuống!

[Đoạn 3]
Công nghệ Trung Quốc hợp nhất với máy chiến tranh phương Tây,
Triển khai ở mọi thành phố, thực hiện kế hoạch chết chóc,
Mark Steele đã cảnh báo, chiến dịch Cứu Chúng Tôi Ngay,
Nhưng đám đông ngủ say nghĩ ông điên rồi.

[Cầu nối]
Thức dậy, thức dậy, vũ khí đã được triển khai,
Mọi ngã tư đều được vũ trang, tự do của bạn bị phá hủy,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei đang kiểm soát,
Tia tử thần điện từ nhắm vào linh hồn bạn!

[Điệp khúc]

[Kết thúc]
DEW trên đường phố... thành phố thông minh là vùng tử vong,
Đèn giao thông là vũ khí... bạn không bao giờ cô đơn.

[ท่อน 1]
ผู้รับเหมาด้านกลาโหม Thales ร่วมมือกับ Huawei,
Gemalto อยู่ในกลุ่ม อาวุธถูกจัดแสดง,
ไฟจราจรในลอนดอนมีมากกว่าที่เห็น,
เลเซอร์พลังงานกำหนดทิศทางเล็งมาที่คุณจากท้องฟ้า

[ท่อน 2]
ยิ่งมีโลหะในร่างกายมาก ยิ่งติดตามได้ง่าย,
การโจมตีนาโนและแม่เหล็กไฟฟ้าประสาทไม่หยุด,
สงครามลับแบ่งส่วนบนท้องถนน,
เสา 5G กำลังส่งคลื่น ระบบอาวุธเสร็จสมบูรณ์

[คอรัส]
DEW บนท้องถนน พวกเขาเล็งไปที่ประชาชน,
อาวุธเลเซอร์ซ่อนอยู่ใต้ไฟจราจร,
การเฝ้าระวังเมืองอัจฉริยะ กำแพงคุกดิจิทัล,
กดปุ่มเดียว ร่างกายมนุษย์ล้มลง!

[ท่อน 3]
เทคโนโลยีจีนรวมกับเครื่องจักรสงครามตะวันตก,
ถูกนำไปใช้ในทุกเมือง ดำเนินแผนการอันตราย,
มาร์ค สตีล เตือนมาตลอด แคมเปญช่วยเราตอนนี้,
แต่มวลชนที่หลับใหลคิดว่าเขาบ้าไปแล้ว

[สะพาน]
ตื่นเถอะ ตื่นเถอะ อาวุธถูกติดตั้งแล้ว,
ทุกแยกถูกติดอาวุธ เสรีภาพของคุณถูกทำลาย,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei ควบคุมอยู่,
รังสีแม่เหล็กไฟฟ้าแห่งความตายเล็งไปที่วิญญาณคุณ!

[คอรัส]

[เอาท์โทร]
DEW บนท้องถนน... เมืองอัจฉริยะคือเขตสังหาร,
ไฟจราจรคืออาวุธ... คุณไม่เคยอยู่คนเดียว

[مقدمة]
إشارات المرور تراقب، ليزر مخفي أمام العيان،
المدن الذكية تصبح مميتة، مارك ستيل كشف المعركة.

[المقطع 1]
مقاول الدفاع ثاليس شريك مع هواوي،
جيمالتو في الخليط، أسلحة معروضة،
إشارات المرور في لندن بها أكثر مما يبدو،
ليزر الطاقة الموجهة يستهدفك من السماء.

[المقطع 2]
كلما زاد المعدن في جسدك، أسهل في التتبع،
هجوم نانو وكهرومغناطيسي عصبي لا يتوقف،
حرب سرية مجزأة في الشارع،
أبراج 5G تنبض، أنظمة الأسلحة مكتملة.

[اللازمة]
DEW في الشوارع، يستهدفون الناس،
أسلحة ليزر مخفية تحت إشارات المرور،
مراقبة المدينة الذكية، جدران سجن رقمية،
ضغطة زر واحدة وجسم بشري يسقط!

[المقطع 3]
تقنية صينية اندمجت مع آلات الحرب الغربية،
منتشرة في كل مدينة، تنفذ مخططات قاتلة،
مارك ستيل كان يحذر، حملة أنقذونا الآن،
لكن الجماهير النائمة تظن أنه مجنون.

[الجسر]
استيقظوا، استيقظوا، الأسلحة منتشرة،
كل تقاطع مسلح، حريتكم مدمرة،
جيمالتو، ثاليس، هواوي في السيطرة،
أشعة الموت الكهرومغناطيسية تستهدف روحك!

[اللازمة]

[الختام]
DEW في الشوارع... المدن الذكية منطقة قتل،
إشارات المرور أسلحة... أنت لست وحدك أبداً.

```
[इंट्रो]
ट्रैफिक लाइट देख रही हैं, लेजर छिपे हुए हैं,
स्मार्ट शहर घातक हो रहे, मार्क स्टील ने युद्ध उजागर किया।

[पद 1]
थेल्स रक्षा ठेकेदार हुआवेई के साथ साझेदार,
जेमाल्टो मिश्रण में, हथियार प्रदर्शन पर,
लंदन में ट्रैफिक लाइट में जितना दिखता है उससे ज्यादा है,
निर्देशित ऊर्जा लेजर तुम पर निशाना लगा रहे हैं आकाश से।

[पद 2]
तुम्हारे शरीर में जितना ज्यादा धातु, उतना आसान ट्रैक करना,
नैनो और इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक न्यूरोस्ट्राइक हमला,
गली में गुप्त विभाजित युद्ध,
5G टावर पल्सिंग, हथियार सिस्टम पूर्ण।

[कोरस]
सड़कों पर DEW, वे लोगों को निशाना बना रहे,
ट्रैफिक लाइट के नीचे छिपे लेजर हथियार,
स्मार्ट सिटी निगरानी, डिजिटल जेल की दीवारें,
एक बटन दबाओ और इंसान का शरीर गिर जाता है!

[पद 3]
चीनी तकनीक पश्चिमी युद्ध मशीनों से मिली,
हर शहर में तैनात, घातक योजनाएं निष्पादित,
मार्क स्टील चेतावनी दे रहे थे, सेव अस नाउ अभियान,
लेकिन सोई हुई भीड़ सोचती है वो पागल हो गया।

[ब्रिज]
जागो, जागो, हथियार तैनात हैं,
हर चौराहा हथियारबंद, तुम्हारी आजादी नष्ट,
जेमाल्टो, थेल्स, हुआवेई नियंत्रण में,
इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक मौत की किरणें तुम्हारी आत्मा पर निशाना!

[कोरस]

[आउट्रो]
सड़कों पर DEW... स्मार्ट शहर हत्या क्षेत्र हैं,

Traffic light for London get more than eye fit see,
Directed energy laser dey point for you from sky.

[Verse 2]
Di more metal wey dey your body, di easier to track,
Nano and electromagnetic neurostrike attack,
Secret compartmented warfare for street,

[Chorus]

Laser weapon dey hide under traffic light steeple,
Smart city surveillance, digital prison wall,
One push of button and human body go fall!

[Verse 3]
Chinese technology don merge with Western war machine,
Deploy for every city, execute deadly scheme,
Mark Steele dey warn, Save Us Now campaign,
But sleeping masses think say e don craze.

Wake up, wake up, dem don deploy di weapons,
Every intersection dey armed, your freedom dey ruin,

Electromagnetic death ray dey target your soul!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Chinese technology nag-merge sa Western war machines,
Naka-deploy sa bawat lungsod, ginagawa ang deadly schemes,
Si Mark Steele nagbabala, Save Us Now campaign,
Pero natutulog na masa iniisip sira na siya.

[Bridge]
Gising, gising, naka-deploy na ang mga armas,

[Utangulizi]
Taa za trafiki zinaangalia, leza zimefichwa wazi,
Miji ya kisasa inakuwa ya kuua, Mark Steele alifunua vita.

[Aya 1]
Mkandarasi wa ulinzi Thales alishirikiana na Huawei,
Gemalto imo ndani, silaha zinaonyeshwa,
Taa za trafiki London zina zaidi ya inavyoonekana,
Leza za nishati zilizolengwa zinakulenga kutoka angani.

[Aya 2]
Chuma zaidi mwilini mwako, rahisi zaidi kufuatilia,
Shambulizi la nano na electromagnetic neurostrike,
Vita vya siri vilivyogawanywa mtaani,
Minara ya 5G inapiga, mfumo wa silaha umekamilika.

[Kiitikio]
DEW mitaani, wanawalenga watu,
Silaha za leza zimefichwa chini ya taa za trafiki,
Ufuatiliaji wa jiji la kisasa, kuta za gereza la kidijitali,
Bonyeza moja na mwili wa binadamu unaanguka!

[Aya 3]
Teknolojia ya Kichina iliunganishwa na mashine za vita za Magharibi,
Imewekwa katika kila jiji, inatekeleza mipango ya kuua,
Mark Steele alikuwa akionya, kampeni ya Tuokoe Sasa,
Lakini umati unaolala unafikiri amekuwa mwendawazimu.

[Daraja]
Amka, amka, silaha zimewekwa,
Kila makutano yamewekwa silaha, uhuru wako umeharibiwa,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei wanadhibiti,
Miale ya kifo ya electromagnetic inalenga roho yako!

[Kiitikio]

[Mwisho]
DEW mitaani... miji ya kisasa ni eneo la kuua,
Taa za trafiki ni silaha... huko si peke yako kamwe.

[Wstęp]
Sygnalizacja świetlna obserwuje, lasery ukryte na widoku,
Inteligentne miasta stają się śmiertelne, Mark Steele ujawnił walkę w oku.

[Zwrotka 1]
Wykonawca obronny Thales w partnerstwie z Huawei,
Gemalto w mieszance, broń na wystawie,
Sygnalizacja w Londynie ma więcej niż widać,
Lasery energii kierowanej celują w ciebie z nieba.

[Zwrotka 2]
Im więcej metalu w ciele, tym łatwiej śledzić,
Nano i elektromagnetyczny atak neuronalny nie przestaje,
Tajna podzielona wojna na ulicy,
Wieże 5G pulsują, system broni kompletny.

[Refren]
DEW na ulicach, celują w ludzi,
Broń laserowa ukryta pod sygnalizacją świetlną,
Nadzór inteligentnego miasta, cyfrowe mury więzienia,
Jedno naciśnięcie przycisku i ludzkie ciało upada!

[Zwrotka 3]
Chińska technologia połączona z zachodnimi maszynami wojennymi,
Wdrożona w każdym mieście, wykonując śmiertelne plany,
Mark Steele ostrzegał, kampania Ratujcie Nas Teraz,
Ale śpiące masy myślą, że zwariował.

[Most]
Obudźcie się, obudźcie się, broń jest rozmieszczona,
Każde skrzyżowanie uzbrojone, wasza wolność zniszczona,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei kontrolują,
Elektromagnetyczne promienie śmierci celują w waszą duszę!

[Refren]

[Zakończenie]
DEW na ulicach... inteligentne miasta to strefy śmierci,
Sygnalizacja to broń... nigdy nie jesteś sam.

ليزر الطاقة الموجهة بيصوب عليك من السما.

[كوبليه 2]
كل ما المعدن في جسمك زاد، التتبع أسهل،
هجوم نانو وكهرومغناطيسي عصبي مش بيوصل،
حرب سرية مقسمة في الشارع،
أبراج 5G بتنبض، نظام الأسلحة كامل.

[اللازمة]
DEW في الشوارع، بيستهدفوا الناس،
أسلحة ليزر مستخبية تحت إشارات المرور،
مراقبة المدينة الذكية، حيطان سجن رقمي،
ضغطة زرار واحدة وجسم الإنسان بيقع!

[كوبليه 3]
تكنولوجيا صينية اتدمجت مع آلات الحرب الغربية،
منتشرة في كل مدينة، بتنفذ خطط قاتلة،
مارك ستيل كان بيحذر، حملة أنقذونا دلوقتي،
بس الجماهير النايمة فاكرينه اتجنن.

[الكوبري]
صحوا، صحوا، الأسلحة اتنشرت،
كل تقاطع مسلح، حريتكم اتدمرت،
جيمالتو، ثاليس، هواوي في السيطرة،
أشعة الموت الكهرومغناطيسية بتصوب على روحك!

[اللازمة]

[الختام]
DEW في الشوارع... المدن الذكية منطقة قتل،
إشارات المرور أسلحة... إنت مش لوحدك أبداً.

```
[Rhagarweiniad]
Goleuadau traffig yn gwylio, laserau wedi'u cuddio yn y golwg,
Dinasoedd clyfar yn troi'n farwol, datgelodd Mark Steele y frwydr heb ffug.

[Pennill 1]
Contractwr amddiffyn Thales yn bartner gyda Huawei,
Gemalto yn y cymysgedd, arfau ar ddangos heddiw,
Mae gan oleuadau traffig Llundain fwy nag a welir,
Laserau egni wedi'u cyfeirio yn anelu atat o'r awyr.

[Pennill 2]
Po fwyaf o fetel yn dy gorff, y hawsaf i olrhain,
Ymosodiad nano a niwro electromagnetig heb ostegu,
Rhyfel dirgel wedi'i rannu ar y stryd,
Tyrau 5G yn pwmpio, system arfau'n gyflawn.

[Cytgan]
DEW yn y strydoedd, maen nhw'n targedu'r bobl,
Arfau laser wedi'u cuddio o dan oleuadau traffig,
Gwyliadwriaeth dinas glyfar, waliau carchar digidol,
Un gwasgu botwm ac mae corff dynol yn cwympo'n ddifrifol!

[Pennill 3]
Technoleg Tsieineaidd wedi'i uno â pheiriannau rhyfel y Gorllewin,
Wedi'i lleoli ym mhob dinas, yn gweithredu cynlluniau marwol yn gyffredin,
Mark Steele yn rhybuddio, ymgyrch Achubwch Ni Nawr,
Ond mae'r tyrfaoedd yn cysgu'n meddwl ei fod yn wallgof mawr.

[Pont]
Deffrowch, deffrowch, mae'r arfau wedi'u lleoli,
Pob croesffan wedi'i arfogi, mae'ch rhyddid wedi'i ddinistrio,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei yn rheoli,
Pelydrau marwolaeth electromagnetig yn targedu'ch enaid!

[Cytgan]

[Diweddglo]
DEW yn y strydoedd... dinasoedd clyfar yw'r parth lladd,
Goleuadau traffig yw'r arfau... nid wyt ti byth ar dy ben dy hun yn y cnadd.

[Sarrera]
Trafiko argiek zaintzen, laserrak ezkutuan begi-bistan,
Hiri adimendunek hilgarri bihurtzen, Mark Steele-k borroka agertu.

[Ahapaldia 1]
Thales defentsa kontratugileak Huaweirekin bazkide,
Gemalto nahasian, armak erakusten,
Londresko trafiko argiek ikusten dena baino gehiago dute,
Energia zuzenduaren laserrak zuregana apuntatzen zeruetatik.

[Ahapaldia 2]
Zure gorputzean zenbat eta metal gehiago, errazago jarraitzea,
Nano eta elektromagnetiko neuroatakea ez da gelditzen,
Kalean gerra ezkutua sailkatua,
5G dorreak pultsu egiten, arma sistema osoa.

[Leloa]
DEW kaleetan, jendea jomuga hartzen dute,
Laser armak trafiko argien azpian ezkutatuta,
Hiri adimendunaren zaintza, espetxe digitaleko horma,
Botoi bat sakatu eta giza gorputza erortzen da!

[Ahapaldia 3]
Txinako teknologia mendebaldeko gerra makinekin batu,
Hiri guztietan zabaldua, hilketa planak gauzatuz,
Mark Steele ohartarazten, Gorde Gaitzazu Orain kanpaina,
Baina lo dauden masek uste dute erotu dela.

[Zubia]
Esnatu, esnatu, armak zabaldu dira,
Gurutzaldi guztiak armatuta, zure askatasuna suntsitua,
Gemalto, Thales, Huawei kontrolatzen,
Heriotza izpi elektromagnetikoak zure arima jomuga!

[Leloa]

[Amaiera]
DEW kaleetan... hiri adimendunak hilketa gunea dira,
Trafiko argiak armak dira... ez zaude inoiz bakarrik.
