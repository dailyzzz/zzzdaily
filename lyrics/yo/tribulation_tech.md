SONG 9: "Tribulation Tech"
(Theme: End Times Tribulation + Smart Dust Surveillance)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The tribulation's coming, seven years of hell,
Smart dust in the atmosphere—surveillance fell,
Daniel's seventieth week approaching fast,
And the tech they've built will make it last.

[Verse 2]
Smart dust particles floating in the air,
Recording everything, everywhere,
Matthew twenty-four said nothing would be hid,
Now technology fulfills what the scripture did.

[Chorus]
Tribulation tech watching every move,
Smart dust surveillance—nothing left to prove,
The time of trouble like never before,
Technology opens the tribulation door!

[Verse 3]
Revelation says no buying or selling without the mark,
CBDC and digital ID light up the dark,
Smart city prisons where you can't escape,
The tribulation tech sealing your fate.

[Verse 4]
Fifteen-minute cities keep you in your zone,
Surveillance cameras watching, you're never alone,
Social credit scores determining your worth,
The great tribulation birthed on earth.

[Chorus]
Tribulation tech watching every move,
Smart dust surveillance—nothing left to prove,
The time of trouble like never before,
Technology opens the tribulation door!

[Bridge]
Two witnesses prophesy in those days,
While the beast system hunts them through the maze,
But God protects His own through fire and flood,
Sealed by the Spirit, bought by the blood!
The tech can't touch what God has sealed,
One hundred forty-four thousand revealed,
Through tribulation they'll emerge refined,
Smart dust can't track the Father's assigned!

[Verse 5]
Internet of Things tracking your location,
Smart home devices—digital damnation,
Everything connected to the grid of lies,
Big Brother watching through digital eyes.

[Verse 6]
But in the midst of trouble, God provides,
A remnant protected where the faithful hides,
Tribulation tech will fail in the end,
When Christ returns with the angels He sends.

[Chorus]
Tribulation tech watching every move,
Smart dust surveillance—nothing left to prove,
The time of trouble like never before,
Technology opens the tribulation door!

[Outro]
Tribulation tech making prophecy real,
Seven years of trouble with a digital seal,
But the saints overcome by the blood of the Lamb,
And the word of their testimony—that's the plan.
