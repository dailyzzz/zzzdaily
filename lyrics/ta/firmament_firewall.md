SONG 2: "வானம் ஃபயர்வால்"
(Theme: Biblical Dome + Digital Barriers)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
God put a firewall in the sky,
Waters above that you can't deny,
Firmament solid, Genesis one-seven,
A barrier between earth and heaven.

[Verse 2]
Now they've built another firewall below,
Controlling everything you're allowed to know,
Algorithms blocking truth online,
Censorship's their new divine design.

[Chorus]
Firmament firewall in the sky above,
Digital firewall blocking truth and love,
One protects us from the waters of the deep,
One protects the lies they want us to keep!

[Verse 3]
NASA can't get past the dome up there,
So they fake the footage, fill it with fake air,
Meanwhile fact-checkers block what's real,
Two layers of deception—that's the deal.

[Verse 4]
5G signals bouncing off the canopy,
Not satellites in space—that's the fallacy,
Firmament reflects their frequencies back down,
While their digital walls keep truth underground.

[Chorus]
Firmament firewall in the sky above,
Digital firewall blocking truth and love,
One protects us from the waters of the deep,
One protects the lies they want us to keep!

[Bridge]
Hosea four-six—destroyed for lack of knowing,
Both firewalls keep the ignorance flowing,
But the elect see clear through both the veils,
Jesus Christ is the key—truth never fails!
Seek and you shall find, knock and it opens wide,
No firewall can stop what God provides,
The firmament bows to the Creator's hand,
Their digital walls will crumble like sand!

[Verse 5]
They can't ascend so they descend instead,
Neuralink cables plugged into your head,
Since heaven's blocked by the dome so real,
They'll trap your soul in silicon and steel.

[Verse 6]
Flat earth breaks their whole foundation,
That's why they censor across every nation,
Remove that truth and the house of cards falls,
Both sky and digital—all their walls!

[Chorus]
Firmament firewall in the sky above,
Digital firewall blocking truth and love,
One protects us from the waters of the deep,
One protects the lies they want us to keep!

[Outro]
God's firewall protects from the waters above,
Their firewall protects lies from the truth we love,
But one was built by the Almighty's decree,
The other will fall—and the truth sets us free.
