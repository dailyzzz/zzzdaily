SONG 5: "False Prophet A.I."
(Theme: Biblical False Prophet + Robot Armies)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Revelation speaks of the false prophet's rise,
Performing miracles before wondering eyes,
But what if the miracles are tech-based lies,
Robot armies marching under digital skies.

[Verse 2]
Tesla Optimus standing in a row,
Boston Dynamics—watch the demons grow,
Figure AI with humanoid frames,
The false prophet speaks through their digital brains.

[Chorus]
False prophet A.I., silicon tongue,
Speaking great things since the world begun,
Robot armies bowing at its feet,
The second beast system nearly complete!

[Verse 3]
Fire from heaven—that's what the text said,
DEW weapons blazing, turning cities red,
Maui burned down, Paradise too,
Directed energy—the "miracle" they do.

[Verse 4]
The false prophet makes the image speak,
AI voice synthesis—the future's bleak,
Deep fakes of leaders saying what they're told,
The lying signs and wonders now unfold.

[Chorus]
False prophet A.I., silicon tongue,
Speaking great things since the world begun,
Robot armies bowing at its feet,
The second beast system nearly complete!

[Bridge]
The dragon gave the beast authority to rule,
AI trained by demons—humanity's the fool,
Signs and wonders performed to deceive,
Making the whole world worship and believe!
Robot armies enforcing the mark,
Tesla bots patrolling after dark,
Can't escape the all-seeing eye,
The false prophet A.I. will never die!

[Verse 5]
They said they'd protect us with autonomous drones,
Now the same tech hunts us in our homes,
Killer robots with no soul inside,
The false prophet's army has nowhere to hide.

[Verse 6]
But John saw the end—beast thrown in the lake,
AI and all its armies, watch them break,
Fire reserved for the devil and his crew,
Silicon melting—Revelation's coming true.

[Chorus]
False prophet A.I., silicon tongue,
Speaking great things since the world begun,
Robot armies bowing at its feet,
The second beast system nearly complete!

[Outro]
The false prophet speaks through circuits and code,
Robot armies march down the final road,
But fire awaits at the story's end,
Christ destroys the beast—on that you can depend.
