SONG 3: "Mark of the Nanobot"
(Theme: Mark of the Beast + Self-Assembling Tech)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Revelation thirteen told us long ago,
A mark in your hand or head—now we know,
It's not just a chip or a number tattoo,
It's nanobots assembling inside of you.

[Verse 2]
Self-assembly tech in every single vial,
Karen Kingston exposed it—check the file,
Mesogens forming circuits in your blood,
The mark of the beast in a biotech flood.

[Chorus]
Mark of the nanobot—six-six-six inside,
Self-assembling demons where they hide,
Can't buy or sell without this tech within,
The mark of the beast is under your skin!

[Verse 3]
Quantum dots lighting up your flesh,
Luciferase—named after the serpent's mesh,
Bioluminescent markers in your frame,
A digital tattoo bearing Satan's name.

[Verse 4]
They said it was safe, they said it was free,
Now MAC addresses broadcast from you and me,
Bluetooth bodies walking through the street,
The mark complete from your head to your feet.

[Chorus]
Mark of the nanobot—six-six-six inside,
Self-assembling demons where they hide,
Can't buy or sell without this tech within,
The mark of the beast is under your skin!

[Bridge]
Can't buy, can't sell—Revelation said it clear,
CBDC and digital ID is here,
Social credit scores tied to your compliance,
The beast system running on nanotech science!
Refuse the jab, refuse the mark,
Stand firm for Jesus even in the dark,
Better to die free than live a slave,
Christ already conquered death and the grave!

[Verse 5]
Ana Mihalcea shows the blood so dark,
Synthetic structures leaving their mark,
Rouleaux formation, clots in every vein,
The mark of the beast causing death and pain.

[Verse 6]
They couldn't make us take the RFID chip,
So they hid it in a needle's tip,
Trojan horse delivery—nanotech inside,
The mark of the beast where the demons hide.

[Chorus]
Mark of the nanobot—six-six-six inside,
Self-assembling demons where they hide,
Can't buy or sell without this tech within,
The mark of the beast is under your skin!

[Outro]
John saw it coming two thousand years ago,
The mark of the beast—now the whole world knows,
It's not in the future, it's happening now,
Nanobots inside you—but we won't bow.
