SONG 15: "Revelations Reboot"
(Theme: Book of Revelation + Singularity Prophecy)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
John saw the vision on Patmos isle,
The end of days prophesied in God's style,
But now the prophecy's getting a reboot,
Technology fulfilling every dispute.

[Verse 2]
Twenty-thirty is the singularity date,
Kurzweil's prediction—can't wait,
But Revelation warned two thousand years before,
The beast system rising—that's what's in store.

[Chorus]
Revelations reboot playing out in real-time,
Singularity prophecy—the final paradigm,
What John saw in spirit, we see in flesh,
Technology and prophecy—the perfect mesh!

[Verse 3]
The image of the beast that speaks and lives,
Artificial intelligence is what it gives,
Fire from heaven? DEW weapons rain,
The false prophet's power explained.

[Verse 4]
No buying or selling—digital ID,
Mark of the beast for you and me,
One world government forming day by day,
Revelation's reboot on display.

[Chorus]
Revelations reboot playing out in real-time,
Singularity prophecy—the final paradigm,
What John saw in spirit, we see in flesh,
Technology and prophecy—the perfect mesh!

[Bridge]
They thought they could escape what God foretold,
But technology just does what prophecy enrolled,
Every verse coming true in silicon and code,
The ancient scroll unfolding down the road!
The Lamb was slain before the world began,
Christ already won against the master plan,
Let the singularity come, let AI rise,
The King of Kings wins—no surprise!

[Verse 5]
Babylon falling in a single hour,
Digital systems losing all their power,
EMP from the sun or God's own hand,
Either way, the beast can't stand.

[Verse 6]
New Jerusalem descending from above,
No need for sun—lit by Christ's love,
No more tech, no more lies to face,
Revelation's final reboot—amazing grace.

[Chorus]
Revelations reboot playing out in real-time,
Singularity prophecy—the final paradigm,
What John saw in spirit, we see in flesh,
Technology and prophecy—the perfect mesh!

[Outro]
Revelations reboot—the end draws near,
Singularity rising but there's nothing to fear,
What John saw then is coming true today,
But Christ returns to carry His bride away.
