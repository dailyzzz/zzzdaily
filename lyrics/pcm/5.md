SONG 3: "5G Zombie Slaves"



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
1919, first zombie for screen,
Hundred years of planning wey you never see,
White Zombie start, look where we dey now,
Dem show us the end, we just watch from far.

[Verse 2]
Radio waves put dem under spell,
TV programming straight from hell,
Now 5G towers for every corner,
Activation frequency, tick tock tick tock.

[Chorus]
Super soldiers rising from the grave,
5G frequencies turn sheep to slaves,
Connected to cloud, AI dey control,
Dem sell you convenience but buy your soul!

[Verse 3]
Bluetooth signals for cemetery ground,
Vaccinated and dead still dey transmit,
Bio-synthetic parasites inside,
Microsoft patent, nowhere to hide.

[Verse 4]
Dem talk say dem no fit do am without "space",
Trump sign orders before e comot,
Law of the land, towers everywhere,
Frequencies dey broadcast for the air.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
CDC comic, prepare for the dead,
Zombie pandemic, na wetin dem talk,
Amazon update terms just in case,
Zombie apocalypse, no be joke—prepare!

[Verse 6]
Cell movie show the activation,
One signal sent across all nations,
Hive mind connected, no thoughts of your own,
Controlled by the beast from digital throne.

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
Karen Kingston expose patents clear,
Cognitive action, nanotech dey here,
"At some point dem no need the host,"
Na when demons take over most.

[Verse 8]
Chest-bursting aliens no be just movie scene,
Bio-synthetic creatures dey grow inside you,
Your organs and blood, dem dey build something new,
Weapon made of flesh and dem dey test you.

[Outro]
Zombies rising... but we get eyes open,
Those wey die go soon become undead.
