SONG 2: "Balls For Your Face"



[Intro]

[Chorus Chant]
Dem put balls for our face, balls for our face, balls for our face,
Dem no talk say suck am, dem no talk say lick am,
Dem no talk say kiss am—
But dem put balls for our face, balls for our face,
From when we small we no fit escape fake space grip!

[Verse 1]
Firmament above, waters dey divided,
Genesis one seven, but dem hide am,
Blue sky na reflection of waters above,
But dem sell you vacuum wey no get air.

[Verse 2]
First na ball, then pear, then flat,
Neil and him clowns no fit keep story straight,
Testicle, penis head, wetin next—shaft?
As the whole world dey deceived, dem sit dey laugh.

[Chorus Chant]

[Verse 3]
P900 zoom, no curvature found,
Flat and still, feet dey ground,
Hollywood basement where dem fake the stars,
Moon landing hoax, never reach Mars.

[Verse 4]
Phone for pocket, cameras and mics,
Eyes for the devil, surveillance delight,
E no dey omnipresent so e need tech,
Building beast system, wetin you expect?

[Chorus Chant]

[Bridge]
Hosea four six, destroyed for lack of knowledge,
Matthew twenty-four, wickedness dey grow,
But the chosen ones dey see clear through fog and smoke,
Earth truth go burn everything!

[Outro]
No more balls... we see through everything,
Flat and still... under Father's will.
