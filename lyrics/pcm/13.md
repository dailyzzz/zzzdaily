SONG 7: "Fake Asteroid Invasion"



[Intro]

[Chorus]
Asteroids falling, na the next big fear,
CGI rocks rolling through fake air,
Project Blue Beam demons for sky,
"Surrender freedom or you go die!"

[Verse 1]
Apophis dey come, na wetin dem talk,
2029, mark that day,
But everything na hoax like COVID,
Fear-based control, na all.

[Verse 2]
Dem need enemy from outer space,
To unite nations, control the race,
Reagan talk for 87,
"Alien threat for unite us under heaven."

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
But space na fake, nothing up there,
No asteroids floating for vacuum air,
Firmament solid, dome above,
Nothing dey penetrate—that story don die.

[Verse 4]
Dem go fake impact, CGI blast,
"Emergency powers" make control last,
Martial law declared for every nation,
One world government—Satan creation.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Don't Look Up, movie show the game,
Condition mind to obey and obey,
Trust science, trust government plan,
Hand over soul to beast and him brand.

[Verse 6]
Armageddon, Deep Impact, all the films,
Programming mind with apocalyptic thrill,
So when dem fake am you go don believe,
Another satanic trick for sleeve.

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
NASA need lie to justify budget,
Trillions of dollars, dem thief and cheat,
"Space exploration" keep sheep for line,
While building beast system by design.

[Verse 8]
Elon Musk with rockets and Mars dreams,
Nothing real, all smoke and schemes,
SpaceX, Blue Origin, all fake,
Building prison for mankind.

[Bridge]
Von Braun for deathbed speak the truth,
"Asteroids go be the last joke,
First Russia, then terrorists, then third world,
Then asteroids—watch lies unfold."
Carol Rosin hear am straight from him lips,
Last card wey dem go play before everything flip,
Fake alien invasion, rocks from sky,
One final lie before millions die.

[Outro]
Asteroids fake... another lie dem make,
Firmament standing... truth dey unfold.
