SONG 6: "Quotes From The Liars"



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Trump talk am clear if you get ears to hear,
"I dey fly all the time, I get jet, clear,
757, fine plane, the best,
If world round, I for know—unlike the rest."

[Verse 2]
Buzz Aldrin slip, no fit keep the lie,
"We no go there," almost cry,
"Na so e happen, good to know why,"
Moon landing fake, dem never touch sky.

[Chorus]
"We go know say our disinformation program complete,
When everything wey American public believe na false,"
William Casey, CIA director, tell boss,
And here we dey—nation of false belief!

[Verse 3]
Hillary Clinton talk say she break glass ceiling,
Eighteen million cracks—na lies spreading,
Glass ceiling fake like everything else,
Puppets for strings dey dance for devil.

[Verse 4]
Red Hot Chili Peppers drop truth for song,
"Space na made for Hollywood basement"—sing along,
Californication tell you everything,
But you nod, no hear nothing.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
"If I be the devil," Paul Harvey start,
"I for swallow whole world, na my plan,
I for subvert churches, whisper for ear,
'Bible na myth,' feed lies for years."

[Verse 6]
"I for make families war, churches divide,
Nations destroy themselves—I for guide,
Judges promote filth, God kicked out,
From courts and schools—just as prophesied."

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
"I for replace true religion with psychology,
Deify science—na wetin I go do,
Tempt priests to corruption, money and boys,
Turn Easter to eggs and Christmas to toys."

[Verse 7]
"I for strip you public, lure you to bed,
With diseases no cure—and you go die,
In other words if I be devil I for continue—"
Wetin e dey do now, ruining humanity!

[Outro]
Their own words condemn dem, truth dey plain sight,
Open your eyes and step into light.
