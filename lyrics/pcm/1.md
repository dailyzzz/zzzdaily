SONG 1: "Clean Release"



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Dem dey feed you lies like baby food,
Dem expect say you go dey calm and oppressed,
But warrior go stand, no go fall for mugu,
Scales go fall when Gospel dey accepted.

[Chorus]
Keep truth for your heart, no mess am when you fart,
And let Jesus enter, make your new life start.

[Verse 2]
Dem dey wipe your yansh then take control,
Promise protection while dem thief your soul,
But when you see clear, you no need their hand,
For solid rock of truth na where you stand.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Waka around with mess for trouser,
Believe news, obey the law,
Dey vomit wetin dem put for your head,
Prisoner of war, spiritually dead.

[Verse 4]
But truth lover get clean release,
No chunks for gas, na peace and power,
Eyes open wide, ears wey dey hear,
Renewed mind, no room for fear.

[Bridge]
Dem wan your power, wan you weak,
Dependent pikin wey no fit talk,
But King of kings no die for slaves,
E rise with power, comot from grave—
Why you dey bow to lower throne?
Rise up soldier, you no dey alone!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let Jesus enter... your new life start,
No more mess... truth stored for heart.
