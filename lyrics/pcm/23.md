SONG 12: "Christ Na King (Warriors Anthem)"



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Keep truth for heart, no mess when you fart,
And let Jesus enter, make new life start!
Dem put balls for our face, balls for our face,
From small we no fit escape fake space!

[Verse 2]
Super soldiers rising from grave,
5G frequencies turn sheep to slaves!
Barry and Michael, power couple from hell,
Deceive whole nation with lying spell!

[Chorus]
Christ na King! Let warriors sing!
Truth dey win, Gospel never fail!
We see through everything, we answer the call,
Beast system falling, Satan stumble and fall!

[Verse 3]
Pear-shaped, oblate, dem no fit keep straight,
Blue marble photoshop—wake up, e no too late!
Asteroids falling, na the next big fear,
CGI rocks rolling through fake air!

[Verse 4]
Six six six for hand or for head,
Take mark of beast or you go dead!
If you dey see this you don break through wall,
Censorship no fit stop the call!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let Jesus enter... your new life start,
No more mess... truth stored for heart,
No more balls... we see through all,
No more chains... free from their game,
Zombies rising... but we get eyes open,
Asteroids fake... another lie dem make,
Obama fall... when Father call,
Michael exposed... everybody know,
Pear-shaped earth... we know its worth,
Flat and still... under Father's will,

[Final Chorus]
Christ na King! Let warriors sing!
Truth dey win, Gospel never fail!
Flat earth warriors with eyes open wide,
We see through darkness, we see through lies!
Chosen ones standing firm, we no go fall,
Jesus na Lord over all!

[Outro - Spoken/Sung]
Christ na King...
Truth dey win...
Gospel never fail...
Seek truth and e go set you free...
John eight thirty-two...
Jesus Christ, the way, truth and life...
Amen.
