SONG 9: "Wake Up Call"



[Intro]

[Chorus]
If you dey see this you don break through wall,
Censorship no fit stop the call,
Share truth with everyone wey you know,
Plant the seed and watch am grow!

[Verse 1]
Dem censor truth for every platform,
Algorithms designed make you warm,
Shadow bans, strikes, accounts deleted,
But Christ truth no go be defeated.

[Verse 2]
Rumble, Bitchute, Odysee stand strong,
Platforms where truth fit sing song,
Trootube, Substack, voices rising,
Filling overflowing cup of freedom.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Karen Kingston dey expose every patent,
Ana Mihalcea dey show wetin dem plant,
Stew Peters broadcast without fear,
Mike Adams break down wetin really dey here.

[Verse 4]
Watchmen for wall no go stay quiet,
Even when enemy become violent,
For such time as this we born,
To blow trumpet, to sound horn.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Time short, window dey close fast,
AI deception, deepfakes made to last,
Soon you no go know wetin real or fake,
Na why now we gats wake.

[Verse 6]
Seek truth, make e set you free,
John eight thirty-two, guarantee,
Jesus Christ, the way, truth and life,
Cut through lies like sharp knife.

[Bridge]
88888888.life,
Truth videos cutting through the fight,
Learn about real Jesus of the Bible,
Not fake one wey churches sell you.
Flat earth truth open doors wide,
Satan shaking, him kingdom crumbling,
Foundational truth so powerful and deep,
Time to wake up from sleep!

[Outro]
Spread this message far and wide,
Truth and Jesus for our side,
Harvest plenty, workers few,
Next soul to wake fit be you!
