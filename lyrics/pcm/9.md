SONG 5: "Pear-Shaped Lies"



[Intro]

[Chorus]
Pear-shaped, oblate, dem no fit keep am straight,
From ball to testicle, now dem dey debate,
Blue marble na photoshop—Robert Simmon confess,
"E gats be fake," yes e talk—we dey blessed!

[Verse 1]
Robert Simmon, Mr. Blue Marble himself,
Put truth for shelf,
"Na photoshop, but e gats be,"
Composite images for you and me.

[Verse 2]
No be photograph, dem never snap am,
Whole world dey fooled, but we finally dey wake,
Every "photo" of Earth na painting, na render,
CGI lies from fake vendor.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Neil deGrasse Tyson with him pear spin,
South fat pass—where we go start?
Yesterday ball, today oblate sphere,
Tomorrow pear—these liars empty!

[Verse 4]
No consistency, no solid proof,
Just computer graphics burst through roof,
Dem change shape when e convenient,
Ball, pear, egg—all fake fruit!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Testicle earth, na wetin dem show first,
Now pear shape, which one worse?
Next dem go talk say we live for shaft,
And na when we all—wait, no laugh.

[Verse 6]
Because e no funny when you see the game,
Every shape wey dem push na part of same game,
Agenda to hide wetin dey under your feet,
Flat plane of truth wey dem no wan you meet.

[Outro]
Pear-shaped earth... we know how much e worth,
Flat and still... under Father's will.
