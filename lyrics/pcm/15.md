SONG 8: "The Beast System"



[Intro]

[Chorus]
Six six six for hand or for head,
Take mark of the beast or die,
You no fit buy or sell without their stamp,
Full control over every land!

[Verse 1]
Digital currency replacing cash,
Everything tracked for one flash,
Bank account frozen if you no comply,
Social credit score—China show why.

[Verse 2]
CBDC coming to country near you,
Central bank digital, nothing you fit do,
Dem flip switch, your money disappear,
Welcome to prison wey you build.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Phones dey track movement, cameras face,
Alexa listening everywhere,
Smart TVs watching while you sleep,
Devil get eyes on every sheep.

[Verse 4]
Internet of things, smart homes connected,
Every word spoken, stored and collected,
Dem know wetin you think before you talk,
AI algorithms—beast—no play with am!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Open source fool the best of best,
Give away genius, fail the test,
Build tools for own enslavement,
Free labor for devil basement.

[Verse 6]
Every app you use dey feed machine,
Every post you make help build the plan,
Dem take your talent, time, mind,
Leave nothing but chains behind.

[Bridge]
Revelation thirteen lay am plain,
Beast from sea go rise again,
Image of beast wey talk and breathe,
AI feeding lies wey deceive and deceive.
Nobody fit buy, nobody fit sell,
Without the mark—one way ticket to hell,
But the chosen refuse, we no go bow,
We serve the King wey wear the crown!

[Outro]
Beast system falling... Satan stumbling,
Chains go break when people wake.
