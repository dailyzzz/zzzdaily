SONG 10: "Frauds And Puppets"



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Frauds and puppets of New World Order,
Cross every line, break every border,
Infiltrate intentions wey start well,
Redirect that energy as dem know how.

[Verse 2]
Cults for left, cults for right,
Both lead to darkness, none to light,
Free will stolen, fed to machine,
Humanity enslaved by wetin dem no see.

[Chorus]
Dem no wan us know how things really work,
Behind curtain where serpents hide,
Steal our power, hijack our will,
But truth keep rising, e go always!

[Verse 3]
Control world for evil gain,
Secret societies, ancient chain,
Freemasonry, Kabbalah, satanic rites,
Pulling strings from hidden heights.

[Verse 4]
Good become evil, evil become good,
Isaiah five twenty, understood,
Dem don flip everything for thousands of years,
Feeding on blood and tears of humans.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
First radio, then television come,
Newspapers, movies, all the same,
Programming minds since 1903,
Century of lies, but now we see.

[Verse 6]
Dem talk say no fit do am without "space",
NASA lying leading way,
Fake moon landings, CGI Mars,
While locking us behind invisible bars.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Clue: dem no fit do am without fake space,
Foundation of lies staring your face,
Remove that pillar, everything fall,
Na why dem panic when flat earth call.
Research yourself, no take my word,
Question everything wey you don hear,
Truth dey there for those wey seek,
Not for proud but for humble and meek.

[Outro]
Frauds exposed... everybody know,
Puppets falling... when Father call.
