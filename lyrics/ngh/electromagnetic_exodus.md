SONG 14: "Electromagnetic Exodus"
(Theme: Biblical Exodus + DEW Weapons Escape)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Moses led Israel from Pharaoh's hand,
Through the Red Sea waters to the promised land,
Now we need exodus from the pharaohs of today,
DEW weapons blazing—we gotta find a way.

[Verse 2]
Electromagnetic frequencies all around,
5G towers rising up from the ground,
Directed energy weapons burning from the sky,
Like the plagues of Egypt—people die.

[Chorus]
Electromagnetic exodus—gotta leave Babylon,
DEW weapons raining fire till the dawn,
Like Moses led his people through the sea,
We need deliverance to set us free!

[Verse 3]
Maui burned with blue umbrellas standing tall,
Paradise, California—DEW made it fall,
Pharaoh used whips, the new pharaohs use waves,
Electromagnetic weapons digging mass graves.

[Verse 4]
Smart meters on every house tracking power flow,
They can target anyone—this we know,
But God parted the waters, made a way through,
He'll part the frequencies for me and you.

[Chorus]
Electromagnetic exodus—gotta leave Babylon,
DEW weapons raining fire till the dawn,
Like Moses led his people through the sea,
We need deliverance to set us free!

[Bridge]
Egypt held Israel four hundred years in chains,
Electromagnetic Egypt does the same,
But God sent Moses when the time was right,
The midnight hour—then came the light!
Ten plagues fell on Egypt long ago,
Ten plagues of tech are falling here below,
But the blood on the doorpost kept the angel at bay,
The blood of Jesus keeps us safe today!

[Verse 5]
Smart cities are the new Egyptian brick,
Surveillance and control—the same old trick,
But the pillar of cloud and pillar of fire,
Still guides the remnant from the empire.

[Verse 6]
Pharaoh's army drowned in the closing sea,
The beast system drowns in eternity,
Every tower, every weapon turned to dust,
In God alone we put our trust.

[Chorus]
Electromagnetic exodus—gotta leave Babylon,
DEW weapons raining fire till the dawn,
Like Moses led his people through the sea,
We need deliverance to set us free!

[Outro]
Electromagnetic exodus from the beast,
From the west, from the north, south, and east,
God makes a way where there seems to be none,
The exodus continues till the victory's won.
