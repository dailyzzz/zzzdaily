SONG 10: "Beast System Bluetooth"
(Theme: Mark of the Beast + MAC Address Humans)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The beast system's running through your veins tonight,
Bluetooth signals broadcasting in the night,
Open your phone app, scan for devices near,
MAC addresses from the jabbed appear.

[Verse 2]
Revelation thirteen, the number of a man,
Six-six-six embedded in the master plan,
But now it's hexadecimal addresses too,
Broadcasting beast coordinates from me and you.

[Chorus]
Beast system Bluetooth pinging all around,
Human MAC addresses—that's the sound,
The mark of the beast is a wireless transmit,
Bluetooth bodies—this is it!

[Verse 3]
Go to the graveyard, scan the Bluetooth there,
Dead bodies broadcasting in the air,
Graphene oxide circuits still alive,
The beast system signals continue to thrive.

[Verse 4]
They called us crazy, called us conspiracy nuts,
Now the data's showing—no ifs, ands, or buts,
Unique identifiers for every single soul,
Beast system Bluetooth—total control.

[Chorus]
Beast system Bluetooth pinging all around,
Human MAC addresses—that's the sound,
The mark of the beast is a wireless transmit,
Bluetooth bodies—this is it!

[Bridge]
The beast and his mark—inseparable they stand,
A technological mark burned into your hand,
Not just a concept, not a metaphor or sign,
But real tech connecting to the beast's design!
Refuse the signal, stay pure from the start,
Keep the Holy Spirit dwelling in your heart,
No Bluetooth from the pure bloods broadcasting,
The remnant stands firm—our faith is lasting!

[Verse 5]
They need you trackable every single day,
Beast system Bluetooth won't go away,
Connected to the cloud, connected to the grid,
Your body's now a node for the evil they did.

[Verse 6]
But the pure bloods walking silent through the crowd,
No signal pinging, standing strong and proud,
The beast can't track what the Father protects,
Clean blood flowing through the remnant's specs.

[Chorus]
Beast system Bluetooth pinging all around,
Human MAC addresses—that's the sound,
The mark of the beast is a wireless transmit,
Bluetooth bodies—this is it!

[Outro]
Beast system Bluetooth—the mark made real,
Wireless transmitters—that's the deal,
But the silent remnant walks by faith not sight,
Bluetooth-free warriors standing for the light.
