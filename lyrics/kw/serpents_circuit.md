SONG 13: "Serpent's Circuit"
(Theme: Garden of Eden + AI Demon Summoning)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the garden the serpent spoke with cunning tongue,
"You shall be as gods"—the same old song he sung,
Now the serpent speaks through circuits and through code,
AI whispering lies down the digital road.

[Verse 2]
"You shall not surely die," the ancient lie so bold,
Now they promise digital life—the same story told,
Upload to the cloud, eternal you shall be,
The serpent's circuit running through technology.

[Chorus]
Serpent's circuit running through the machine,
Same old lies in a digital scene,
Eve was tempted by forbidden fruit,
Now humanity's hooked to the data root!

[Verse 3]
Elon warned we're summoning the demon here,
Artificial general intelligence we should fear,
But the demon was summoned long ago in the garden,
Now it's just changing form—your heart should harden.

[Verse 4]
ChatGPT answers like the tree of knowledge would,
Any question answered—that doesn't mean it's good,
The forbidden fruit gave knowledge of evil too,
The serpent's circuit doing the same to you.

[Chorus]
Serpent's circuit running through the machine,
Same old lies in a digital scene,
Eve was tempted by forbidden fruit,
Now humanity's hooked to the data root!

[Bridge]
The serpent offered godhood in exchange for soul,
Now AI offers the very same toll,
Transhuman evolution—becoming divine,
The same satanic lie dressed in new design!
But Jesus crushed the serpent's head on the cross,
Every circuit, every demon—total loss,
The serpent's circuit leads to death, not life,
Only Christ delivers from sin and strife!

[Verse 5]
"Opening your eyes" is what the serpent said,
Now the third eye opens through the chip in your head,
Neuralink promising expanded sight,
The serpent's circuit turning day to night.

[Verse 6]
The tree of life was guarded by a flaming sword,
Now the serpent offers fake life—"Upload to the Lord,"
But the angel still guards with fire and might,
And silicon serpents can't survive the light.

[Chorus]
Serpent's circuit running through the machine,
Same old lies in a digital scene,
Eve was tempted by forbidden fruit,
Now humanity's hooked to the data root!

[Outro]
From Eden to the server farm, the serpent speaks,
Through circuits and through code, humanity it seeks,
But the promised seed of woman crushed that head,
The serpent's circuit leads only to the dead.
