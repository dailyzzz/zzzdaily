SONG 7: "Nephilim Nanobots"
(Theme: Biblical Giants + Transhumanist Enhancement)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Genesis six—the sons of God came down,
Took daughters of men from every town,
Nephilim giants—corrupted DNA,
Now they're doing the same thing in a different way.

[Verse 2]
Nanobots rewriting your genetic code,
Transhumanist enhancement down the road,
CRISPR and mRNA changing who you are,
Nephilim technology from a distant star.

[Chorus]
Nephilim nanobots swimming in your blood,
Corrupting human DNA like the ancient flood,
Giants walked the earth in days of old,
Now synthetic beings emerge—souls bought and sold!

[Verse 3]
"As in the days of Noah," Jesus said,
Genetic manipulation—humanity misled,
The fallen angels tried to corrupt the seed,
Now nanobots finish what demons decreed.

[Verse 4]
Super soldiers rising, enhanced and tall,
DARPA programs answering the call,
Human 2.0 they want to create,
Nephilim reborn—a corrupted state.

[Chorus]
Nephilim nanobots swimming in your blood,
Corrupting human DNA like the ancient flood,
Giants walked the earth in days of old,
Now synthetic beings emerge—souls bought and sold!

[Bridge]
God sent the flood to wipe the slate clean,
Nephilim destroyed—no more to be seen,
But the enemy returns with technology new,
Corrupting the bloodline all over—round two!
But fire this time, not water to come,
The judge of all earth won't be outdone,
Nephilim nanobots will burn in the flame,
Christ returns victorious—forever the same!

[Verse 5]
They call it evolution, call it progress too,
But it's Genesis six happening to me and you,
Mixing iron and clay, Daniel saw it clear,
The final kingdom where Nephilim appear.

[Verse 6]
Your body is a temple, Paul said it true,
Now they're desecrating it with nanotech through,
But the pure in blood who refuse the mark,
Will shine like stars even in the dark.

[Chorus]
Nephilim nanobots swimming in your blood,
Corrupting human DNA like the ancient flood,
Giants walked the earth in days of old,
Now synthetic beings emerge—souls bought and sold!

[Outro]
Nephilim walked and Nephilim fell,
Their nanobot children will meet the same hell,
What God destroyed once, He'll destroy again,
The pure bloodline of Christ will remain—Amen.
