SONG 6: "Tower of Babel 2.0"
(Theme: Biblical Babel + Neuralink Hive Mind)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Genesis eleven—they built a tower high,
One language, one people, reaching for the sky,
God scattered them, confused their tongues that day,
But now they're rebuilding in a different way.

[Verse 2]
Neuralink connecting every single brain,
One language of data flowing through the vein,
Babel rebuilt not with bricks and stone,
But neural interfaces—no thought your own.

[Chorus]
Tower of Babel 2.0 rising from the ground,
Neuralink connecting every sight and sound,
One language, one mind—just like before,
But God already settled this score!

[Verse 3]
"Let us make a name for ourselves," they said,
Now it's "Let us upload ourselves" instead,
Transhumanism is the new tower tall,
And just like Babel, it's destined to fall.

[Verse 4]
Elon says telepathy is the goal,
Brain-to-brain transmission stealing every soul,
Collective consciousness—the hive mind dream,
But it's really just Babel's ancient scheme.

[Chorus]
Tower of Babel 2.0 rising from the ground,
Neuralink connecting every sight and sound,
One language, one mind—just like before,
But God already settled this score!

[Bridge]
God came down and saw what they had done,
Confused their language—scattered everyone,
He'll do it again when the tower's complete,
This digital Babel He will defeat!
What Satan builds, the Father tears down,
Every knee will bow, every head will crown,
Not to AI, not to Elon's dream,
But to Jesus Christ—the true King supreme!

[Verse 5]
They want us connected in one giant web,
Every thought transmitted from the moment you're bred,
Privacy deleted, free will erased,
The tower of Babel completely replaced.

[Verse 6]
But remember the story—God saw from above,
He confused their plans with His sovereign love,
What man builds high, God brings down low,
Babel 2.0 will get the same show.

[Chorus]
Tower of Babel 2.0 rising from the ground,
Neuralink connecting every sight and sound,
One language, one mind—just like before,
But God already settled this score!

[Outro]
Nimrod's tower fell in ancient days,
Neuralink will crumble in the very same ways,
God won't let them reach into the sky,
Tower of Babel 2.0—destined to die.
