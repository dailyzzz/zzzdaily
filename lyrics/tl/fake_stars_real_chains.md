SONG 11: "Fake Stars, Real Chains"
(Theme: Fake Space/Stars + Digital ID Enslavement)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They told us stars were suns a trillion miles away,
But they're lights in the firmament—Genesis says,
The same liars that gave us fake space above,
Now give us digital chains disguised as love.

[Verse 2]
If they lied about the cosmos, they'll lie about your name,
Digital ID 2026—it's all the same game,
Fake stars in the sky, fake freedom below,
Real chains around your neck that they don't want you to know.

[Chorus]
Fake stars, real chains—the pattern's always there,
Lies about the heavens, lies about the air,
Space is fake but the slavery is real,
Digital ID is the final deal!

[Verse 3]
NASA steals trillions for lights on the dome,
While WEF plans to track you from your home,
Fake moon landings, real surveillance state,
Fake asteroids coming, real lockdown fate.

[Verse 4]
They couldn't put satellites in space that's fake,
So ground-based towers are all it takes,
Starlink's not in orbit—check the facts,
While digital ID puts chains on your backs.

[Chorus]
Fake stars, real chains—the pattern's always there,
Lies about the heavens, lies about the air,
Space is fake but the slavery is real,
Digital ID is the final deal!

[Bridge]
Job thirty-eight asks where were you when I laid earth's foundation,
The stars sing together for God's creation,
Not balls of gas but angels bright,
While they wrap you in digital chains tight!
The same deceiver from the garden of old,
Lies about the stars, buys and sells your soul,
Fake space program, real beast system rise,
Open your eyes to both sets of lies!

[Verse 5]
They need the globe to make you feel small,
Insignificant speck, nothing at all,
But flat earth truth restores your worth,
You're the reason God made the earth.

[Verse 6]
Digital ID makes you feel like a number,
A data point tracked while the masses slumber,
But in Christ you're known by name and face,
Neither fake stars nor chains can take your place.

[Chorus]
Fake stars, real chains—the pattern's always there,
Lies about the heavens, lies about the air,
Space is fake but the slavery is real,
Digital ID is the final deal!

[Outro]
Fake stars above, real chains below,
Two different lies from the same evil flow,
But the truth of the earth and the freedom in Christ,
Breaks both deceptions—that's the sacrifice.
