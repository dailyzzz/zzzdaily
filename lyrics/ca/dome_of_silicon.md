SONG 1: "Cúpula de Silici"
(Theme: Flat Earth Firmament + AI Digital Prison)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They built a prison underneath the dome,
Silicon valleys where the demons roam,
Firmament above us solid as steel,
But they've built another one—digital and real.

[Verse 2]
Genesis tells us waters above the sky,
Now they're drowning us in data, algorithm lies,
God's ceiling keeps the waters held at bay,
Their ceiling keeps the truth locked away.

[Chorus]
Dome of silicon, dome of glass,
Two prisons built to hold the mass,
One made by God to protect His creation,
One made by man for our digital damnation!

[Verse 3]
They couldn't break through the firmament wall,
So they built the metaverse to trap us all,
"Space is fake" so they made cyberspace,
Another false reality shoved in your face.

[Verse 4]
Elon says we might be in a simulation,
Preparing your mind for the great migration,
Upload your soul to the cloud they say,
While the real dome above keeps heaven at bay.

[Chorus]
Dome of silicon, dome of glass,
Two prisons built to hold the mass,
One made by God to protect His creation,
One made by man for our digital damnation!

[Bridge]
The firmament holds—they cannot breach,
So digital heavens is what they preach,
Transhumanism is their tower of lies,
Building to God but they can't reach the skies!
Babel fell and so will this,
Silicon dreams turn to the abyss,
Christ is the door, the only way through,
Not fiber optics—the Gospel is true!

[Verse 5]
P900 zoom shows no curve below,
But the algorithm curves what you're allowed to know,
Flat earth truth gets shadow banned quick,
While they push the pear-shaped testicle trick.

[Verse 6]
Smart dust falls from towers not stars,
The firmament holds, can't escape to Mars,
So they trap you in VR, AR, AI,
Another dome of silicon—do or die.

[Chorus]
Dome of silicon, dome of glass,
Two prisons built to hold the mass,
One made by God to protect His creation,
One made by man for our digital damnation!

[Outro]
Two domes standing—one by God, one by man,
Only one will hold according to the plan,
Silicon crumbles when the Father calls,
But the firmament stands while Babylon falls.
