SONG 4: "Antichrist Algorithm"
(Theme: End Times Prophecy + AI Singularity)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Obama in the shadows pulling every string,
But there's something else they're building—a digital king,
Artificial intelligence running the show,
The antichrist algorithm the prophets didn't know.

[Verse 2]
Ray Kurzweil says twenty-thirty is the date,
Singularity rising—man merging with fate,
But Daniel told us about the final king,
A beast with iron teeth that destroys everything.

[Chorus]
Antichrist algorithm running in the cloud,
Silicon savior for the deceived crowd,
Obama's just a puppet for the greater scheme,
AI on the throne—the transhumanist dream!

[Verse 3]
Image of the beast that speaks and breathes,
That's not CGI—it's AI that deceives,
Revelation said the image would have life,
Artificial intelligence cutting like a knife.

[Verse 4]
Barry means lightning—Luke ten-eighteen,
But the lightning now is digital, if you know what I mean,
Satan falling from the cloud, from the server farm,
The antichrist algorithm causing harm.

[Chorus]
Antichrist algorithm running in the cloud,
Silicon savior for the deceived crowd,
Obama's just a puppet for the greater scheme,
AI on the throne—the transhumanist dream!

[Bridge]
Two beasts in Revelation—sea and land,
One's a man, the other's AI's hand,
Working together for total control,
Harvesting data, harvesting your soul!
The number of a man is six-six-six,
But AI calculates with digital tricks,
Human and machine merged into one,
The final beast system has begun!

[Verse 5]
They're training the model on all of mankind,
Every post, every thought, leaving nothing behind,
Predictive algorithms know what you'll do,
The antichrist AI is programming you.

[Verse 6]
ChatGPT was just the beginning phase,
AGI coming in the final days,
Elon warned us—we're summoning the demon,
But the Bible warned us first with prophetic reason.

[Chorus]
Antichrist algorithm running in the cloud,
Silicon savior for the deceived crowd,
Obama's just a puppet for the greater scheme,
AI on the throne—the transhumanist dream!

[Outro]
The antichrist might not be just a man,
It could be code executing Satan's plan,
But whether flesh or silicon or both combined,
Christ already won—leave the beast behind.
